              <p>I purchased the Keurig Classic and I am truly amazed at how fast I have a cup of freshly brewed coffee.  I have continuously purchased a lower priced similar product.  When my brewer bit the dust I knew then I had to have a Keurig.  I believe this brewer will not let me down.  I am usually awake between 2-3 a.m. each morning and no more worries about my favorite cup of coffee is way less than a minute away.  I truly love this Keurig and living with sleep disorder I know my new Keurig will not let me down.  Thank you Keurig for being there for me when the whole world is sleeping.</p>
