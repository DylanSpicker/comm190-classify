"***Updates are located at the bottom of this review.******Original Review***Up until recently, I had never been much of a coffee drinker except for the occasional seasonal flavored latte drinks but I was having trouble keeping up with my very active twin toddlers. We already had a standard coffee maker but I didn't want to brew a whole pot of coffee at once and single-serve coffee makers seem to be very popular so I figured it couldn't hurt to give it a try. I had seen several different Keurigs from the basic ones to very fancy ones but wanted to purchase one that both fulfilled my needs to brew a single cup of coffee and wasn't too expensive so I opted to buy the Keurig K55 Coffee Maker in black.When the Keurig arrived, I eagerly opened up the box to get it set up and start using it! I found it fairly simple to set up since there is a Use and Care Guide included and it's easy to follow the step-by-step instructions. I'd say the setup only takes a few minutes and then you are ready to brew your first cup of coffee. There are lights on the brewer that illuminate and walk you through the brewing process but once you are used to it, it becomes second nature and now, I don't even have to think about it, which is good in the early morning when I'm not thinking straight and need my coffee!Brewing: To brew a cup of coffee is very simple. You'll need to turn on the brewer by pushing the power button. The power button and heating lights will illuminate and the Keurig will make some noises while it heats up. When the three cup sizes illuminate in blue, you know it's time to brew your coffee. Set your coffee mug on top of the drip tray and lift the handle for the K-cup pod holder. Place a K-cup pod in the holder and lower the handle completely until the three cup sizes are blinking. The three sizes are: small cup (5.25 ounces), small mug (7.25 ounces) and large mug (9.25 ounces). Select your size and the coffee will be ready in about a minute. If the water reservoir is low on water, the ""add water"" light will illuminate and the process won't continue until you've filled the reservoir. Once it's stopped dripping, you may remove your mug and enjoy your coffee! If someone else wants to brew a cup of coffee right after yours is done, all they have to do is remove your K-cup pod since they are single-use pods, add theirs and repeat the process.Water Reservoir: The reservoir holds 48 ounces of water so you don't have to fill it up every time you want to brew a new cup of coffee, which is one of the reasons I selected this model. I make about two cups of coffee every day so I end up refilling the reservoir every few days. There are filters to use with the water but I purchase bottled water so I haven't used the filters at this point. When the reservoir needs to be filled, I remove the reservoir, take off the lid, fill it up with water, place the reservoir back in the Keurig and replace the top.Cleaning: I feel this Keurig is fairly simple to clean. The drip tray is removable and I usually wipe it down with a damp paper towel a couple times a week and wash it in water, soapy water occasionally. I also like to wipe down the exterior since the front part of the Keurig gets splatters of coffee on it. You can also clean the pod holder, funnel, needles and water reservoir and lid. Be careful as the two needles used to puncture holes in the K-cup pods are very sharp.Coffee Pods (the best part!): The Keurig K55 Coffee Maker uses the K-cup pods, which you can purchase nearly everywhere and there are many brands and flavors to choose from. You don't need to buy any specific brand with this coffee maker. As long as they are K-cups, they should work and I haven't come across any pods that don't work. I've been having a lot of fun purchasing different flavors and brands since I have several friends and family members who also have Keurigs so it's a lot of fun to swap coffees! I prefer flavored coffees and there are so many out there to try but my favorites are the Green Mountain flavors in Caramel Vanilla Creme and Wild Mountain Blueberry. There are K-cup pods in different price ranges and it's nice to have that option since everyone has a different budget. The nice thing with this brewer is that the flavors don't tend to blend from one cup to the next. For instance, my mom and I have brewed cups of coffee one right after the other (different flavors) and neither of us have noticed the other flavor in our respective cups. I've only brewed one cup of apple cider with this and haven't noticed the previous coffee flavor in the apple cider or the apple cider in my next cup of coffee. In this brewer, you can use all kinds of coffee flavors from flavored to medium and dark roasts to hot chocolate to apple cider. I typically choose the small mug (7.25 ounces) setting since I like the flavor. It isn't too strong or too watered-down for me but others may prefer other settings.Programmable Auto Off Timer: You can set the brewer to turn off two hours after the last cup of coffee has brewed (included in the instructions). I just turn the Keurig on and off as I need it but it's nice to have that option.Noise: Some people have stated that this brewer is noisy. I've found it's the noisiest when it's taking water from the reservoir and it sounds like a loud hum. It's not too loud when it's brewing the cup of coffee. I occasionally get up earlier than my husband and kids and brew a cup of coffee and no one has woken up (I'd say there is about 30 feet between the kitchen and bedrooms with the doors closed). When we have guests and they brew coffee before I wake up, I can't hear it at all.This Keurig is made in China and mine had a packaging date of August 2016, a month before I purchased it. I've been using it for two months and haven't had any problems with it at all. It measures about 12 inches deep (from front to back), nine inches wide (side to side) and 13 1/2 inches tall. I've had several family members use it and my parents and in-laws have found it fairly simple to use after I show them how to brew the coffee since we all have different models. Ever since I started drinking coffee, I've had better success with staying more alert and awake to take care of my twins and buying this Keurig has been well-worth every penny we spent on it! I have no regrets buying it and have been having a lot of fun finding different flavors to try. As with all of my reviews and especially any appliances and electronics reviews, I will periodically update this review, add in any new information I discover and adjust my thoughts and star rating, if needed. If you, or someone you know, is interested in a Keurig, I highly recommend this one. It's a great model that is nice on your wallet and will brew a great cup of coffee as often as you'd like!***Update 04/25/2017 - I've had this Keurig now for almost eight months and it's still working great for us! I typically brew four cups of coffee a day now to keep up with my kids and I've had no trouble with using this Keurig. When we have guests and are switching pods a lot, I never notice a strange taste at all (since we all like different flavors). I clean out the drip tray and wipe the whole machine down at least once a week to keep it looking nice. We only use bottled water in it so I've never had to use the filter. When we go away for a few days, I always wipe everything down and empty the water reservoir so it can air out and dry. I still highly recommend this Keurig if you want a good single-cup brewer that isn't incredibly expensive!"
"The machine started to have problems after only a couple of weeks. I thought this was a one time occurrence, but it continues to fail. It works for a couple of days, then it just doesn't make any coffee. The coffee just drips out slowly, as if no pressure is used to ""push"" the water through the k cup. The k cup is heavy and full of water after removing it. It's not clogged or anything, I rinse it regularly. A total disappointment, I will ever buy any Keurig product ever again. I have this machine for less than 2 months and can't return anymore."
"In the forty years of our marriage, we have owned several well-known brands of coffee makers. However, we feel that the Keurig K55 coffee maker has proved superior to any of our previous coffee brewers.Last year I invested in our first Keurig coffee maker, and I chose the K15 for individual servings. This worked out so well that a few months later, I bought another for my office and I loved my second Keurig as much as I loved the first one. Then last winter I decided to purchase another Keurig, only a different model that would accommodate several servings.I bought the K55 model because it has various featured options. This includes offering the choice for different hot beverages without the extra step to refill the tank each time with water, and this is due to the larger 48 oz. water reservoir. In addition, this enables us to make a variety of hot beverages in rapid succession, within a few seconds instead of waiting for all the water to reheat.  Furthermore, the Keurig K55 offers a personal ‘custom tailored’ brew by letting us determine the strength of our coffee, and we have a choice of three. The smallest amount for a 6 oz. provides the strongest brew and the other two servings are an 8 and 10 oz.I like strong coffee, or sometimes I like to have flavored coffee, and my sister-in-law likes the same coffee that I do. My husband prefers a milder brew, and he never drinks flavored coffee. My son drinks tea, and likes to try different varieties and my grandson loves sampling different selections of hot chocolate.The Keurig K55 has a fast set-up, with easy to follow and systematic directions from the manual. It offers us a variety ways to make coffee, tea or just to heat water and all without any major modifications, because it just goes from one task to another.Below are some of the general features, and all are well designed and ‘user friendly’.CONTROL PANEL:All the controls are on the top right of the coffee maker and I like the flat slope surface that slightly slants down toward my eye level, and therefore, I don’t need to step on my tiptoes to read the buttons.On the panel, there are 5 press buttons and each one has an LED light to reduce ‘user error’.Power: Green LEDAuto Off: Green LED - (this is the automatic timer and when activated will automatically power off after 2 hours).3 Brew Size Servings – corresponding size to the serving size and each with a Blue LEDa.  Cup Size - yields 6 oz. – which will provide the strongest brewb.  Small Mug - produces 8 oz.c.  Large Mug – dispenses 10 oz.Aside from the 5 press buttons to regulate the Keurig coffee maker, there are 3 other LED light indicators.1.  Add Water – a Blue LED will light upIf there is not enough water, the coffee maker will not work, therefore I consider this indicator as a safety feature, as well as a resolution to a possible ‘user error’.2.  Descale – will light up with a Red LED lightThis is another handy feature, to indicate necessary cleaning maintenance.3. Heating – while the water is heating, a red LED powers on, and then powers off when the water is hot and ready for a brew.WATER RESERVOIR:Included with the Keurig K55 is a Charcoal Water filter Cartridge Kit with 2 charcoal filters. This will eliminate the unwanted chemical taste that is in some water systems, and good tasting water is essential for a delicious cup of coffee. The recommended life span for each charcoal filter is approximately 2 months or 60 ‘full-tank’ refills. There are several selections for Replacement Charcoal Filter-Pods available on Amazon.com.The water reservoir attached to the left side is easy to remove with a slight lift up and outward motion. It fits inside a base and the tank is easy to remove and replace without any struggle. Alternatively, remove the reservoir tank cover, and pour water in from a bottle or a container.DRIP TRAY:This is much more than ‘just a drip tray’, under the cover is a 1” deep receptacle that will accommodate 8 oz. of a liquid spillover. Therefore, if the user makes an error and pushes the wrong brew amount for a smaller cup, this will save the kitchen counters and the floor from a major flood.In addition, this coffee maker will accommodate my 7 ¼” coffee thermos by sliding the drip tray out from bottom base, and I can have my thermos filled when placed on the bottom flat tray base.THE KEURIG K55 ACCOMMODATES REUSABLE COFFEE FILTERS:My favorite coffee is from fresh beans that I grind myself, and therefore it’s important to me that a coffee maker will accommodate a reusable filter. The K-Cup pod holder on the K55 is very easy to remove and it literally takes less than 10 seconds. Just tap the bottom of the pod holder with a finger and the K-Cup holder slides out with ease. The reusable K-cup filter then slides in place within the groove, and works with perfection for a delicious cup of fresh ground beans, or any ground coffee.The reusable coffer pod filter that I use is the Keurig My K-Cup Reusable Coffee Filter (Single) – and this is compatible with the Keurig K55 model.I purchased this from Amazon last spring, and in addition, I use this same filter with my Keurig K15. https://www.amazon.com/Keurig-5048-Reusable-Coffee-Filter/dp/B000DLB2FI/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1486296530&sr=8-1&keywords=Keurig+My+K-Cup+Reusable+Coffee+Filter+%28Single%29In conclusion, the Keurig K55 is a well thought-out designed coffee maker, with user-friendly features. This machine comes with a ‘Charcoal Water Filter Cartridge Kit and 2 charcoal pod filters, which guarantees excellent coffee, even though we have ‘hard water’ (which tastes awful) in our water system. In addition, I love that Keurig does NOT use a breakable glass carafe, which was the thing that broke most often with our previous coffee makers."
"I would give no stars if I could. When we received this product it was supposed to be ""new"" but it was clearly used. There were sticky fluids on the drip tray. Also, inside of the water reservoir smelled like wet towel. When I ran it empty, the water did not come out clear, instead there were coffee grounds remaining from whoever used it last. I am EXTREMELY disappointed.Additionally it did not come with some of the included items such as the 4 count K-cup and no extra filters. I am going to definitely return this product. This is really unacceptable."
"Haven't used it yet, but came in a nice, undamaged package promptly. Protective packaging inside, also included was unsweetened iced tea (3pack) and coffee and hot cocoa (4pack) the product itself has no scratches or esthetic issues. Tape was even folded over for easy removal from product . Overall satisfied for a first time Keurig buyer :)"
"I received an older entry-level Keurig a couple of years ago and last week I decided to upgrade to a larger model with a reservoir.  First, I didn't fit under my cupboard.  OK, I could live with that.  But worse,  my new K55 imbues beverages with a horrible plastic taste and smell.  I tried all the tips, and today I've run about 40 brewing cycles with everything from vinegar to vodka to rubbing alcohol.  The reek isn't coming from the reservoir or pod holder--the smell is emanating from inside the housing so I believe it is the heating element.  (I'm using the same pods and filtered water I used successfully with my first Keurig, so I know that's not the problem.)  Ugh, it shouldn't be this much trouble to make a cup of coffee.  I will be returning this."
"August 2 2016.Worked fine for 45 days and then started giving me trouble. Called customer service and they instructed me to do a descaling on the machine. Purchased a $14 bottle of KEURIG descale solution, yes I did say $FOURTEEN DOLLARS! Once the descale was finished the machine works once again. I foresee trouble with this sensitive and complicated device. One piece of advice: Consult You Tube Keurig hack videos, I found that $1 distilled white vinegar will descale as well as a $14 Keurig bottle will. Keurig rewards your purchase by sticking it to you for FOURTEEN DOLLARS for descaling solution. THANKS, KEURIG!August 9 2016UPDATE Keurig sent me a new machine, no charge, and a $15 voucher for more product."
Works great. Build quality obviously cheap. Buy the 3 year warranty for $7. No clue if it will make 4 cups of coffee for the next three years or not...but who cares if you have a warranty and can replace through Amazon.
"After three or four of these Keurig machines purchased over the past 6 years, we are done.  We have decided to go back to the old fashion Mr. Coffee drip machine.The Kuerig does work great for single servings, but we were constantly having to clean it or replace it.  I am about two months in to using the drip machine and am glad I went this route.  We've also noticed we aren't using as much coffee beans, which we grind for each pot!"
"Bought this and quickly the machine broke. Amazon replaced it. Less than 2 months later, the replacement broke. Can't replace the replacement because I'm 6 days over 60 days from the original purchase. VERY DISSATISFIED!!!"
Wrong one.  I ordered a K55 the box came quick and it works. The trouble is on the bottom of the Keurig the model number is K40.The box says K55 so i do not know whose fault it is.
Bought this April 12 and it died today Oct 8. Third time this has happened and last time I buy one of these. Why should I have to buy a new keirig every time it breaks. Poorly made and total disregard for customer service or help fixing it let alone replacing it for me. Done!
"I ordered two of these machines in a 3-week period, and each had to be returned for the very same malfunction. The first one was great until the 3rd day, on which it stopped pumping the water through the K-cup. Returned that one for a replacement, which proceeded to also die on the 3rd day. Perhaps this is a defective batch of machines? I have owned several Keurigs over the years and they have never given me trouble. The one that I replaced with these two had lasted about 6 years before it started leaking water from some internal secret space. I'm going to try a different brand now. I don't want to do a 3rd return! What a pain!"
"I've had three Keurigs over the years. This one is better than the other two (both were the original, I don't know the model number), in that it's quieter. Noticeable quieter. Brewing is about the same (which I like).BUT, about 20% of the time, this doesn't work at all. The pump (I guess) makes noise and either doesn't do anything or brews a few drops only. The problem didn't start until after a few months, but I wish I still had my old one.Truth is, I'd seen other reviewers saying the same thing, but I hoped for the best - wish I'd listened. Not happy."
"The Product Information indicates clearly Origin : USA but this is made in China. FALSE!  I just returned it.This is misleading information. I don't  by products that made in China. I don't support a government that treats its people like animals. Most of  ""Made in China"" products are dangerous; especially with electronic products. They are very unsafe!"
"Update:  owned this for 2 weeks, it has already broken.  The motor/pump has stopped pulling water through the unit.  at least I'm still in the return window.  This unit is clearly not as well built as my last keurig, which was a commercial one.This is the 3rd keurig I have owned.  (Last one just died, after 6months of the motor stalling/making noise when filling.  It lasted maybe 4 years).  This one seems a cheaper plastic. Also wish it had a larger water reservoir, this is like 3-4 cups on largest cup setting, but maybe I just ordered the wrong one.  It'd be great if the had a separate, larger water reservoir that could be purchased as an accessory.  (Update: I confirmed with keurig that none of their other reservoirs would fit this unit)"
"We bought a keureg around 10 years ago when they first came popular and loved everything about our unit. After letting my ex have it year ago, I figured it was time to get myself one. The quality is NOT what it used to be. It just feels cheap if I can be totally honest. The finish on the handle as well as the keureg logo looks very cheap and the plastics all feel thin and flimsy. Also, you hage to put down a towel in front and around it kat so all the splashes don't make a big mess. Our original unit NEVER made a mess like that and felt solid and felt like high quality paint and materials were used.It's too bad to see that a product that was so well built 10 years ago started using cheaper materials. You'd think more success and publicity of these over the years would've helped them make them even better - but it seems to be the other way around unfortunately.Needless to say, I will not be purchasing any more keureg products after this. Now that home espresso machines are getting so much more affordable I'll be buying one of those next. The quality of coffee (if you're a true coffee drinker) out of these keuregs, with or without your own coffee, is average at best. If you're a true coffee drinker skip this and save up for an espresso machine!"
"I've been a fan of Keurig since they first came out several years ago. At that time the k-cups were not available in grocery stores and no one had ever heard of the machine. Now they're everywhere. Anyway, my previous model (my third) finally died after several years and I ordered this one. While it is not as feature rich as my other one which is not made any more, it is still a very nice machine. I didn't want one with the carafe, that seems to defeat the purpose of making one cup at a time. But maybe that's just me.Pros:takes standard k-cupseasy and foolproof to use-put cup in, push down handle, hit button2 hour power off switchheats up quicklyeasy to useCons (though not for me but maybe for others):plastic parts including the handle you push downonly 3 cup sizes to choose fromno time or heat controls"
"I purchased first keurig with extended warranty in November 2016.  I use only distilled water and descaled and changed the filter regularly. First one stopped making a full cup early June 2017. On June 7 amazon shipped me a replacement. Today, one day - after their return policy -  this 'new' one has started making only half cup coffee. I have tried cleaning three times, no luck. Lets see if amazon or keurig honors the original warranty."
"I bought this to replace out old Keurig maker which died after six years of daily use.  One factor that limited out options was that we wanted something that we could slide under our cabinets above our granite counter top, and the clearance there is a bit limited.  So any really tall unit was ruled out.  After considering all of the remaining options and prices, I decided to get a ""no-frills"" unit this time.  Our old unit had a lot more features, like a clock, a timer, programmable temperature . . . I was a bit concerned I would miss all of those features.Turns out I don't miss them at all.  In some ways, this unit is better than the old one.  For one thing, the time  you have to wait between making cups seems shorter.  For another, the extraction process seems to be better ""tuned"" in terms of the amount and flow rate of the water.  The coffee tastes noticeably better.We have been using this for two months now, and overall we are very pleased with it - especially for the price.  I am not sure if it will last as long as out last one, but it is also less expensive to replace.  I will come back here in six months and a year and post an update.  But so far . . . so good!"
"Overall I like this Keurig and it makes good coffee, but there are a couple of things that are not my favorite..  First, I am not a fan of having water sit in my coffee machine for extended periods of time.  This brewer works by holding water all the time so if you don't drink coffee for a while, the water just sits there.  We use humidifiers in the house at times, and if we don't clean out the standing water from the humidifier, it leaves a disgusting pink film that I would not enjoy in my coffee.  The other issue I have is that every once and a while the coffee pours out all over the place, not in a nice stream.  When it does this, it makes a mess because some of the coffee spews outside the rim of the mug.  I like this machine ok, but there are probably better out there."
"This is my 3rd Keurig machine in 8 years.I am very familiar with most Keurig machines because I had 3, my adult children,  friends and my office has commercial Keurig machines.  Now this one, the K55 is fine at making a hot cup of coffee,  it fits, without issues the refillable k cup, and any brand k cup pod works perfect.  It is very quiet compared to Keurig models made 2 years ago.  Now the truth about the handle that you lift to put the k cup in, this handle is cheap, thin, brittle and sharp.  Keurig dropped the ball on this. It's the only part, the handle,  that you need to touch every time you want to make a cup of coffee,  and the handle is cheap thin sharp plastic."
"I love my Keurig but I've started noticing an issue that I don't know how to fix.  I'm going to say this is a design flaw rather than a product flaw.  When I use my favorite K-Cups, ""Donut Shop"" regular K Cups after a few cups (4-6) my K-Cup starts to clog up and does not dispense the normal amount of water and in addition it has lots of extra grounds in it.  So, this does not seem to be as common with other K-Cups, but I do not like other K-Cups that much... I wish there was an easy fix / simple solution."
"I don't know what's going on with this model, but this Keurig is so not worth the money. It starts out fine, but when you want a 2nd cup it gives you a small cup, even if you don't choose that option. Sometimes it's even less than a small cup. Then, you have to pull out the plug and reboot it. Sometimes it flashes and you have to pull out the plug again! I thought this particular one I had purchased was defective, so I tried another one. It did the same exact thing and it was brand new! The point of this coffee maker is to have your coffee fast and easy. This is not what I wanted and certainly did not expect. If you want a Keurig,  I highly recommend you stay away from this model."
"My former Keurig was dying a slow death when I replaced it recently with this K55 model.Pros: Easy to use, no complicated settings or controlsCons: 3 cup sizes and the largest one is *maybe* 10 oz - barely a mugful and certainly not a travel mug. The reservoir is smaller than my older model.I did find something more meeting my specifications for the same price at my local Kroger grocery on clearance so I returned this model for the Keurig K500. It has a small 'footprint' on my countertop and a touch screen.Keurig has increased their inventory and decreased the functionality. Now that they have  ""Hot"" and ""Kold"" beverage makers, my ice tea pods no longer work in my keurig. If I want a travel sized mug of coffee, I am asked to purchase K-Mug pods. I wish my old Keurig coffee-maker hadn't died."
"I bought this Keurig K55 Single Serve Programmable K-cup coffee maker in May 2017.  It was used once in June and a few times in July and then it started making a clicking noise as it brewed the coffee and stopped producing coffee.  We have tried refilling the water reserve, plugging into a different outlet, making sure we are using only certified K-cup pods and nonetheless, the coffee maker doesn't work.  We have held down the little silver lever that locks the pod into place and sometimes that allows the coffee maker to release about 1/3 of a cup of coffee. Now I am told that I can't return the coffee maker because the time for manufacturer support expired after 60 days. So, I am throwing it out."
"They are definitely making their product the cheapest way possible. I had the same model prior. This one lacks in quality. I will use it till it fails, then checking out the competition!  Things that were stainless are now plastic. The mechanical movements are not smooth. Always think I'm gonna break it. Feels like a toy.Jan 3 2017 JUST AN UPDATE: This coffee maker has already stop functioning!!! I will never buy anything made by Keurig! It is a worthless investment that does not perform for any legitimate length of time. I am most sincerely disappointed in the machine. I am going to see if the dealer will reimburse me for my loss."
"Very disappointed with this model.  Water container small, cups sizes small, water not as hot as it should be.  It's clear their cheapening the machines.  I've ordered a different model in the hopes it's better.....if not, going to have to look for another brand....So disappointed as we've been such fans of theirs....."
"Very nicely packaged, easy (relatively) to assemble, and works quickly...Be sure to read this:---------------------------------1. Make sure you set-up the filter inside the water container properly...2. I use bottled water to fill the reservoir-It does fill with the ""in the door"" water dispenser on my fridge, but it's awkward3. When you are ready for coffee, be sure the unit is ON and the silver handle is up, exposing where the cup goes...4. Let the water heat up (light comes on) and THEN drop in the cup and close the cover(silver handle down) and5. Make sure your cup is under the spout and select the appropriate size cup button...Seems a no brainer but in the AMyou could easily forget and have a cup overfill.Also-Since there's a fixed amount of coffee in each cup, I'm ASSUMING that if you make a small cup, your coffee will be stronger than if you make a large cup, since a large cup will have the same amount of coffee but more water, hence it'll be more diluted.. and vise versa...Pros:Ease of serving multiple peopleEasy to try different coffee varieties(hot chocolate, tea, etc)Coffee stays fresher longer in the sealed cups, than if you bought a large container ofbeans or ground coffeeMUCH less mess to deal with! Regular coffee makers leave a mess of grounds behind that sometimes get everywhereAlmost never any grounds IN your cup...Just pure coffeeCons:Expensive...I paid $98 for the unit and nearly $40 for a 40 pc variety pack-So it's over $1/cup, which is at least double thecost of ground coffee, but of course, still less expensive than a coffee chain..Space-Takes up quite a bit of counter space-Esp since I bought the Mind Reader ""Anchor"" Triple storage drawer and the machinesits on top of it...I have to pull it out from being under the cabinet so the ""lid"" doesn't hit the underside of the cabinet when I open itto insert/remove a k-cupNoise-It does make some noise, I believe it is the pump that is used to push the water up to the k-cup..But not really any louderthan any other coffee makers..OK, maybe a little louder"
"The Keurig arrived defective/damaged. Waste of time and effort. Have to ship it back. If you think yours has arrived damaged as well (my first clue was that it doesn't stay open, but it also sounded wrong when filling with water) you can check how they are supposed to be at a place like Bed Bath and Beyond. The K55's in store seem fine. This one was not.  I would not buy from this seller."
"We bought a Keurig K55 coffee maker.It really is a colossal waste of money. Each pod costs around 50-70 cents each for 1 cup of coffee. Plus we have to use filtered or bottled water.So I bought reusable pods. But the coffee grounds are too fine so there's some disgusting sediment in the bottom of the cup and the coffee taste, of course, is almost intolerable.I've heard so many rave reviews for the Keurig that I'm now convinced that those reviews are fake reviews and Trump should look into that. Forget immigration, the wall, World War III. He needs to look into the waste and phony reviews for the Keurig.Three stars because expensive or not the coffee is pretty good. I still prefer the old, manual Melitta coffee system."
"I had a Mini Keurig (Model K15) which produced lukewarm coffee, frequently blew grounds in the coffee cup or on the counter, and quit working entirely after 2 years.  This machine (Model K55) takes up more space, but the coffee is nice and hot, and the water reservoir conveniently holds enough for five cups before refilling. So far, all the coffee grounds are staying in the pods where they belong.  This appliance is mostly plastic and has a cheap look to it, but for the price, what can one expect?  If it lasts more than 2 years I'll be very pleased with it."
"Been using Keurig for about a month and like it but was noticing a low humming sound.  At first I did not know where it was coming from...the outlet, refrigerator, lights.  But finally determined it was from the Keurig.  When unplugged, humming stopped.  Researched this problem online and found other people had this problem.  Some notified Keurig and were given another coffeemaker.  I called and was told that there is no safety issue (which was my concern) with the Keurig and it was not necessary to replace unit.  Even though they say there is no fire hazard, I unplug unit after each use.I have no complaints about the quality and function of my Keurig....just the humming noise.Addendum:  Forgot to mention that the machine is turned off and hums. Humming doesn't stop until unplugged."
"Great buy and very simple to put together when it first arrives. You'll be brewing your first cup of coffee very soon. Make sure to wash out the water tank with soap and maybe run through one or two cycles of hot water being dispensed. First couple of times I've used it, there was a slight plastic taste to the coffee. However, after throughly washing the water thank with soap that flavor completely went away. Will probably have to refill the water tank every 3-4 full size cups."
"It's pretty great actually.  We use it every day.  The only small criticism is that the coffee it produces is a little on the weak side.  That may not be the fault of this device in particular, but rather the general approach of Keurig and their K-Cups (of which we've tried several varieties, all with the same ""problem"").  I suspect either the K-cups need more coffee grounds, or their generally too coarsely ground (which my be required for the device to function)"
This thing is terrible.  I can not get rid of the plastic/ chemical taste in my coffee.  I ran it through many times with clean water and also tried vinegar.  I must have sent at least a doz reservoirs worth through and it still reeks of plastic.  Something is wrong. Will be returning it.
"I love my Keurig!  Never ever did I think I'd spend this kind of money on a coffee maker, but you really can't put a price on having super fresh, steaming hot coffee every single time.  I'd had another by-the-cup brewer previously, and it took SO long to brew every cup, and even then it was only mildly warm. The Keurig K55 brews my coffee nice and hot in just a minute or two. The best part is that even half-asleep at 5am, I can figure out how to use it to get my early-morning caffeine fix.I avoided buying these for so long because the k-cups aren't recyclable, but I've found some that are completely able to be recycled and I have the reusable pod cup as well, so I don't feel as guilty any more."
"I used to have a small, inexpensive, one-cup coffee maker. I loved it because it was lightweight, didn't take up a lot of counter space and worked fine. I used my own coffee and the only downside is it had to be filled with water for each cup.  *Not a big deal*  But I thought I'd keep up with the trend and get a Keurig.  What I like is that it has a decent reservoir for water and that I have the option to use a refillable pods.  Get the cheap refillable pods, like from Big Lots or online.  The Keurig refillable pod is not worth it, because you have to pop out the plastic insert holder that stays put for pre-made pods and it takes away from the convenience of the Keurig experience. I'm a one-cup-a-day person and the quantity of coffee that a pod holds makes each cup a little too weak for me; so instead I have to set it for the medium size cup level, which I think is only about 4 oz.OK, so to sum up, the water reservoir is the only reason I like this Keurig.  There are some options for making coffee here, but this is an expensive gadget and no better than my $10 Kitchen Collections maker from Old Time Pottery."
"I purchased a used-like new version of this thru Amazon Prime for about 25% less than the new price.  It arrived well packaged, but not in the original package, and exactly as described.  It worked perfectly out of the box, and I have been using it daily for about a month with no problems at all.  This purchase was to replace a Mr Coffee branded Keurig machine that finally gave out.  This is much better designed than the Mr. Coffee one.  It produces a stronger coffee that is hot and does not have to further heated in a microwave.  It heats up fairly quickly when turned on.  The water reservoir is large, and is easy to remove and refill.  The on/off button does not have to be held down for a few seconds to turn it off - it turns on/off immediately.  And, the interface is simple and easy to understand which is an absolute must for the elderly visitors that come to our home who are mystified when presented with too many buttons/options on technology.  I am very satisfied with this purchase."
"The coffee maker delivers the much-needed coffee to my office. A must-have for a place without an institutional coffee-machine, at least for a coffee addict like myself.Don't even try to follow the instructions on page 16 of the manual! The funnel is poorly designed and the instructions to clean it are even worse. The two parts of the funnel are held together by a pair of brackets. The instructions state that the funnel parts may be separated by ""pulling on it until it pops off"". In reality, the two brackets have to be pulled out first using an appropriate instrument. If you try to ""pull on it until it pops off"" one of the brackets will simply crack or break. Could it be a test?On the bright side, the Keurig customer service will send you a replacement funnel right away."
"I researched and tried out at friends' and family's homes several of these pod style coffee makers because I wanted the best for the most reasonable price.  I couldn't afford to make a bad choice.  This was going to be a simple luxury for my Retirement. And as I said before, I love great coffee!  After playing and testing several brands and styles, I decided on this one and I couldn't be happier to be its proud owner!  Now retired, I am drinking more coffee than before and that's because I am making better cups!  BTW, I love strong black coffee!In retirement, I knew I would not be able to afford the K-cups for everyday use so part of my research included alternatives.  First I bought the JavaJig and filters and I will tell you it is nice because you can easily chunk the grounds into a compost bucket or the garbage.  BUT for me, the coffee was not as good and strong and the machine would often get confused as to what size cup I had chosen.  Instead, I recommend going ahead and spending the extra money to get the official Keurig re-usable coffee filter for using your own coffee and saving money.  It works as well as the boxed k-cups!  Worth it!"
"In love with my new Keurig!  I sought after this specific K55 model because my dental office has one and I think the coffee taste great coming from it.It came with 4 kcups to test out. I love that you can put hot cocoa pods or even just brew hot water to come out with your tea bag of choice. Brews 6, 8 or 10 oz so you can choose cup size accordingly. I was able to buy reusable kcup pods as well, so I can brew my own grinds as needed.It's a little noisy when it takes water from the reservoir but I can't hear a thing if my husband is up before me using it. I have not had issues with it spitting or splashing water around.The water reservoir and drip tray are removable. There's a auto-off option which shuts the machine off 2 hours after the LAST cup was brewed, not 2 hours after powering on. There's a light that will come on when more water needs to be added and there's a light when the machine needs to be descaled of hard water build up.Even when the drip tray is removed I cannot fit my 18 oz flask so I need to brew it into a mug and pour it in my flask for on the go.  Overall I am satisfied with this model and the low price I paid here on Amazon!"
"We have had 2 Keurig coffee makers, I used to rave about it, me being a chef, never thought I would have one, now, I loved it and told everyone! I was like an advertisement, no joke! This one, our second one, is about 4 months old if that, it's a lemon. All problems in the morning when we don't need problems. I've tried all of the simple repairs, decale, clean the needle. Won't brew, spewing water back into the reservoir. I'm a pretty easy customer, if it works, I'm in. I hate writing negative reviews.I think I'm going back to a French press, the Keurig machines seem to be getting cheaper (meaning flimsier) by the model, yet the price doesn't change. I am sad, I really loved this product, but I can't support something that is expensive on the front end and on the kcup end, but doesn't work properly. This unit has been nothing but problems. I miss an easy cup of coffee in the morning."
"Yes, it is noisy, but it is also the best coffee maker I've ever used.  The first cup, according to the manual, takes about 4 minutes.  In reality it takes about ONE minute.  The coffee settings are spot on and it's perfect every time. Having the filter in the tank greatly improves the flavor of the coffee even though I've been using only my Pur filtered water with my old coffee maker--that extra filter makes a big difference.One of the consumer testing sites says this is the absolute best buy of all the K-cup coffee makers, and I agree 100%."
My first Keurig was a gift from my daughter. I really liked having a good fast cup of coffee that was brewed from my own coffee blend.  It only lasted about a year and quit working.  I thought I'd buy another one but a number of people I talked to advised against the Kurig brand because they don't last very long.  I should have listened.  I bought the Model K55 and it quit in about a year.  That's $200 worth of coffee makers in about 2 years.  That doesn't make sense.  I'll never buy another one and I'd advise anyone not to buy one unless they plan on replacing it often and spending about $100 per year for their coffee maker.
We have had 4 Keurig's from day one of their emergence. This new unit has been replaced once and I now need to send number 2 back! Sad that a great pioneer has reduced quality so much!
"So very disappointed. It took me a lot of reviews online and asking around. Everyone said get a keurig, best coffee maker ever. We bought it April 2016. Indeed it functioned great. Unfortunately about 3 months later the water dispenser began to slow down. I did what all the reviews said, flush it with descaler. I did so not to mention did the paper clip trick and emptied all the water to start over. I still can't get the machine to function properly. I'm not sure what to do. My husband thinks it was a lemon. Been kind of half brewing coffee when the machine decides to work. Should have purchased the warranty. Oh well lesson learned, now in search of a new coffee maker."
this machine has been my best and most worth investment in college so far. in a freshman and i make coffee every morning so i can keep up with all my assignments. i've researched online and the inconvenience most people experience is that the machine start malfunctioning after a short period of time. the maker needs maintenance at least once a month and trust me its gonna work at least 8-12 months JUST CLEAN ONCE A MONTH. Good luck!
Great for an apartment or house where coffee is had occasionally. I love this Keurig because it hold the perfect amount of water to last me a couple of days and it is very versitile. It is not heavy or hard to move. It's easy to use and there are so many k-cup options.Perfect size for 1-3 people drinking coffee or tea moderatley without having to refill the tank every day. I would also reccommend getting the reusable k-cup from Keurig that will allow you to put your own ground coffee in the container and brew a single cup. Best Keurig for the value I believe.
"I was debating for a few years actually to get a Keurig or not. The high prices on the K-cups were holding me back. I'm somewhat of a coffee snob who loves al different kinds of coffee, especially flavored coffees! I have been using a Single Serve coffee maker with a reusable basket for the last few years, and my biggest complaint was, the flavored coffees, to a degree, lost their special aroma and flavor after just a few days in the bag. I tried different types of storage, but with the same result. Also, the coffee could, in my opinion, be hotter. My first cup of coffee with my new Keurig was Mudslide from Gloria Jeans Coffees. I was blown away! The flavor, the temperature of the coffee after brewing was fantastic. And I brewed this cup at the 10-ounce setting. Since then, I have tried Lattes from Gevalia, Mocha from StarBucks, hot chocolate and I have also used a reusable K-cup with my own beans, Chocolate Cherry from Cameron Brothers. I will definitely recommend this product to others! Now, if they would please start making biodegradable K-Cups!"
"I have had two Keurig coffee makers in he past but decided to go with this basic model K55 as I really don't need all the extras.  However with that said, I have found this basic model to be unreliable.  There is something not quite right with the water pumping mechanism that gets the water from the reservoir into the machine so it can heat and dispense into the cup. Only after removing and resetting the water reservoir numerous times can I get it to work properly which is quite frustrating when you just want a quick cup of coffee to start your day.  In addition it is quite noisy when operating."
"Seriously we loved the first one we got so much that we had to buy another one ?? my mom needed one for her little apartment ?? sharing fun, but so is having your own. You can buy a reusable k cup and add nothing in it, this will make a great hot cup of water or you can add your own loose leaf tea to the cup and get tea however most tea can't be brewed this way without burning your tea but works great with nettle or rosehip and hibiscus flower, these aren't actual teas so I think that's why it works fine. There's tones of k cup flavors too ?? I had to make a drinking station after I got mine because I find i can have so many choices with this wonderful machine I ended with way more than the average joy would want. Easy to set up easy to use and shipping was so fast ! Packed up well."
I am probably the last person on earth to finally break down and purchase a Keurig. I need A LOT of coffee in the morning and could not fathom the idea of waiting for one cup at a time.I visited my daughter who has a Keurig and was pleasantly surprised at how fast the coffee is made. I especially like the fact that it is piping hot. The hot plate with conventional coffee makers just doesn't seem to be able to keep coffee as hot as I like it.
"This was a present to me and I couldn't be happier. I've had zero issues with this brewer, making 2-3 cups of coffee daily. Refillable k-cups brew perfectly, so do any disposable k-cup drinks I brew. This model doesn't have the sensor for 'real' kcups which is one of the reasons I chose it. I do wish the water reservoir was a little bigger, but it's not really that big of a deal having to refill it every other day. It sure beats making a pot of drip coffee every morning. I also loved my 4-cup sample pack. 3 coffees and 1 hot chocolate. :) I'm very pleased with this brewer, and I don't have issues with my coffee splattering on the machine like I see some people having. But I generally make the two bigger-sized coffees and the liquid has less distance to drop."
"This product worked fine for a while, but now, after about6 months, it is not working right. No matter what setting I have it on it brews less than a full 6 oz cup. I have tried cleaning it to no avail. I thought I bought an extended warranty but apparently not. I have looked over the product description and most small appliances like come with a 1-year warranty, but it does not look like this does. I am out in the cold. I feel like I got burned. I will never buy another Keurig brewer of Amazon again. If I bought this at a store, I could return it."
"This is the second one of these we have bought and it last about 4 months, we don't use it that often either?  It just stops making coffee, we clean and change filters and all area but just doesn't last.  Going to try a cheaper one to see if it last longer.  It's crazy to pay that much money and it not last longer than this."
Bought this Keurig machine in February of this year.  Used it only 6 times and now all of the lights just flash off and on.  It does not work anymore.  Would not recommend this machine to anyone.  Will have another update when I see if the warranty will cover a replacement.
"Same as my other unit I gave my sister, except this model has a water filter, which I absolutely love and the water container comes out to fill, which my other unit didn't have so it makes it easier to wash and clean... bonus!!"
"I love this machine. I just recently joined the Keurig fade and love it. So easy and really not the much more if you look for deals. If you purchase a Keurig, and register your machine, you get your first purchase 50% off. (up to 5 boxes) So, I purchased the more expensive brands I like. I have had no issues and it's pretty easy to operate. I did purchase the older model as I did not want to have issues with any K-cups in the 2.0 version. I don't think you should have to do all of these hacks in order to brew older cups you may have purchased. I use filtered water so I have never had to use the filter system that came with it. However, if I had to do over again, I'd like the bigger reservoir. I find with 3 people drinking coffee in the morning, it depletes quickly. Otherwise, I'm very happy with my purchase!"
We got out first keurig second hand because someone was throwing one away because they got a new one. I would have never bought one new before but now we can't love without it. It makes coffee and tea making so much quicker and easier.  We bought this version for my parents and in-laws after we fell in love with ours. None of us needed anything super fancy so this basic model is great. My husband loves being able to make a cup in the morning even if he's running late because it's so fast and easy. My mom loves it because for the first time in 50yrs she doesn't have to make my dad coffee because he'll do it himself with the keurig.
"This the second machine I purchased after sending the first back when it stopped working after ten cups of coffee.  I have had this replacement machine for less than one month, and it also has stopped working.  You can imagine my annoyance when I looked forward to that first morning cup only to have to resort in making myself an cup of instant coffee!  I am returning the second machine, also, but I certainly do not want a replacement."
"Failed after three weeks. Kept having to re-insert the water reservoir like another recent reviewer, and then it only worked some of the time. Amazon refunded my purchase, but the hassle of wagging this big old thing down to UPS was aggravating.Another reviewer suggested going to Walmart and getting a comparable machine, and that's exactly what I did. Walmart and Target sell a Keurig K50 which is about the same except that the K55 has a strange steel wool filter in the water supply that had to be replaced every few months. I much prefer the simpler one.The other benefit of purchasing a Keurig locally is that you can go get a replacement and have coffee going again the same morning."
My single cup Keurig died after years of service and I was without a coffee maker. My first thought was panic!!! What do I buy to replace it. For a week I did a lot of research on the Internet before purchasing this model of Keurig. I am not disappointed. It is easy to operate! Directions are easy to read and understand. Water heats up fast! The coffee is hot! If I fill the water reserve to the top I can get 3 large cups of coffee before filling it up again. Makes morning coffee fast!! I like the fact I can choose the size of the cup depending on how much coffee I want to brew. Price was good on Amazon. Glad I purchased this model of Keurig!!
"This thing is garbage. I bought one for my office and I can't get it to work properly. I read the owners manual all the way through and I'm doing exactly as it instructs (it shouldn't require any level of intelligence to operate). It only fills my coffee cup up an inch on every cup size setting, even if the water in the tank if filled up to the brim. I didn't open it for several weeks after I purchased it and now I've missed my return window per Amazon's policy. I have a different Keurig model at home that is much better made. I may just have the 1 in a million defect model, but I'd advise going with a different model if you're on the market."
I ordered this and followed the directions. Then made coffee. The next morning it didn't work. We took out the filter and it worked. Ok..it worked for a about a week. That was long enough for my hubby to throw out the box it came in. All of a sudden it quit working again! We fooled around with it and finally gave up and bought a different model from Same. Really unhappy about this.
"I liked the old versions better. This one seems to have a few small issues. The medium and large brew size choice are so close in volume it is hard to tell the difference.Light in the reservoir seems not as bright as one in the older model I had, making it hard to see when the tank is near empty. Also now the machine can sense when you do not use official Keurig endorsed cups, which is irritating."
"I bought this machine on October 5th - it is hardly used (maybe once per week or so) and it has already malfunctioned twice. I ordered a new part, arrived, put it in, worked for maybe a month, now it won't dispense more than an ounce of coffee at a time.  I've wasted many K-cups trying to get it to work.  No way to get ahold of anyone at AMAZON for help whatsoever. .  So, it basically lasted less than 5 months.  I'm not a happy camper."
"I've owned two of the bigger versions of this brand and loved them.  This smaller version has a much very small reservoir for holding water which is a bit annoying.  The biggest issue with this machine is that it is very very loud.  Much louder than the others I have owned.  Would not recommend for that reason.  It is also annoying to have to first hit a button to start the machine warming water, wait a while until it's done, then press the button to choose how many ounces of  beverage you want.  Then lower the ""jaw"" of the machine into the waiting k-cup.  The bigger versions do not require this multiple step process."
"Not to happy with this product. I thought it would be great around the holidays when everyone was over so that whoever wanted coffee, tea or hot chocolate they could make a cup of whatever they preferred. It makes a couple of cups with no problem but then the next few you have to stand next to it and hold the handle down to keep the water pouring. It has done this from day one even when I was the only one making a cup so it's not from over use."
"Been using for a week now and this morning it would not heat so pulled out the manual and there was nothing about what to do about this.  The blue lights came on and I pushed one and it made a very loud noise fro a couple minutes but did not brew.  I turned off, unplugged and waited about 5 minutes and tried again.  This time it worked, so I thought perhaps I'd better register the unit in case I had to have it replaced and read in the manual that the serial number could be found on the bottom of the gift box?, and on the side of the housing behind the water reservoir.  There is no serial number anywhere on the machine and when I unpacked the unit I tossed the box as I do because the serial number is always on the product, so now I have a machine that might be breaking and I will probably not be able to have it repaired or replaced.  In addition, is says it's a K55 but on the bottom it states that it's model K40"
"Total Junk.  What product breaks after 6 months?  Purchased in June of 2016, broke Jan 2017.  We tried to clean as recommended by Keurig as well as per videos on YouTube, but still the pump would not work.  This is the second Keurig in 2 years, and I can confident to say this product is junk, and we will not be buying a third Keurig.  As a weekly purchaser on Amazon, I want my money back or at least credit."
"I purchased this to have as a replacement for my older Keurig. in September although I did not use it until in December.  I have had nothing but problems with the new one.  Sometimes it works , sometimes it doesn't.  Guess it depends upon the mood it is in !!!! Unfortunately, because I did not use it within a month of purchase according to Amazon (my fault for not reading), it can no longer be replaced.  A WARNING TO PURCHASERS, MAKE SURE YOU TRY IT OUT BEFORE YOUR 30 DAY DEADLINE !!  I am presently back to my older model .  Thank goodness I kept it. Not sure what I will do with it.  It's like throwing money out the window."
"My cousin has a coffee pot. It has, in all likelihood, never been cleaned. I always wanted a Keurig coffee maker. That cold November morning when I wanted some coffee was the turning point. There were things growing on that coffee pot that modern science could not identify. That was when I ordered my most awesome Keurig. And it has turned out to be a fine idea. You can do better. But I don't know how. Enjoy."
"I received this Keurig several days ago. I had a Nespresso for several years and it kept leaking too much into the bottom reservoir. So we decided to change. This Keurig was just the right size for our small kitchen. Since we are heavy coffee drinkers and others who visit us, well we have already given it a full test. So far perfect in every way. The three sizes let you select how strong or lite you want your cup. We are very happy and would highly recommend it."
"Great, simple coffee maker. We deliberately bought this older model as it accepts any K-cups and we can also use our own ground coffee using a refillable K-cup filter we bought separately."
I purchased the Keurig Classic and I am truly amazed at how fast I have a cup of freshly brewed coffee.  I have continuously purchased a lower priced similar product.  When my brewer bit the dust I knew then I had to have a Keurig.  I believe this brewer will not let me down.  I am usually awake between 2-3 a.m. each morning and no more worries about my favorite cup of coffee is way less than a minute away.  I truly love this Keurig and living with sleep disorder I know my new Keurig will not let me down.  Thank you Keurig for being there for me when the whole world is sleeping.
"So, I really like the Kuerig.  I bought this one for my Mom, who can only have one cup of decaf a day, and she likes New England decaf a lot.  And he coffee maker made the worst coffee known to mankind.  So, I got her this, and like it so much that I bought one, my brother bought one, as did my niece.  Super convenient.  And...my ice always made a pot of coffee, I'd have one mug, go exersize, and when I'd come back up, there'd be none left.  So, easier to buy the Kuerig than fight with her????"
"Produces a GREAT cup of coffee!  Love the flavor selections.  One bad point...I have had this for less than 2 months now and I have to send it back for replacement.  The water reservoir has a problem and it has spilled many cups of coffee.  At first I just wanted the reservoir replaced, but Keurig said it was out of stock and would not be expected to ship for just over a month.  Since I gave my other coffee maker away, it's easier and much faster to replace the entire coffee maker through Amazon, like Keurig recommended.  I would definitely recommend the extended warranty with the machine when you get it.  It's cheap and you may need it later after the original warranty expires.  I usually never buy the extended warranty, but in this case (from what I've read by long-term Keurig users), it's the old adage, ""they don't make em like they used to""!!!!!!!"
We don't drink coffee so we bought it for hot chocolate and herbal teas. It does great with tea but the k-cups of hot chocolate seem a bit weak. We tried reusing the k-cups with some third party lids for the chocolate but they left a good deal of the chocolate in the cups. We finally gave up and just use the Keurig for hot water and add the chocolate. It is much more convenient than anything else we have used.
This product is amazing! I would definetly recommend this as a nice Father’s Day gift or Christmas Gift for anyone. It’s affordable and easy to use. It only takes a day to get the hand of it if you are use to using the old fashion pot method. It’s comes with 4 kcups which helps a lot and comes with instructions and water filters. It’s very modern shape and modern looks make it even better to use! So I would 100% recommend this.
"When I bought the same version of this coffee machine about five years ago, it was over $300. Now it's less than a hundred bucks. I use it every day and it works great. It is my rock. It gives me the strength to get through my day. Don't fall for the 2.0 version that forces you to use their socialized Green Mountain brand. This one lets you pick whatever kind of coffee you want. I prefer the Black Rifle Coffee CAF brand and that would not be possible on a 2.0 because Keurig doesn't make it. This is a quality coffee maker and it's big enough for a whole family."
"I bought this product on Nov 28th, 2016 (from Amazon.com LLC). The Amazon return window closed on Jan 31, 2017. Guess what... The water stopped filtering through and this Keurig conveniently stopped working on Feb 6, 2017. I even tried running the machine with water several times without a k-cup to no avail. It luckily does carry a 1-year manufacturer's warranty, and I was on the phone nearly an hour with the Keurig Support. The only reason I did not give this a 1 star rating is because Keuring did agree to honor their warranty and send a replacement for their machine. Now it's a wait for 7 more days and a hope that the replacement does work. Although they did replace it, the waste of time and harassment of having to call the coffee maker support within the first 90 days after buying it just isn't worth it."
"Pros: Makes good coffee very quickly and with little or no preparation or cleanup, so I give it 5 stars mainly for being so convenient. Cons: While the coffee is good, it is not quite as good as coffee made carefully using a French press or Aeropress or similar techniques, so if you are a ""coffee snob"" you may find the coffee made with the Keurig to be so-so. Also, the coffee it makes is not super-hot, so if you add milk or cream it may be a cooler cup of coffee than you are used to. Bottom line: Outstanding convenience and good coffee flavor make this great for day-to-day coffee making. Caveats: I have only had this product for about a week, so I cannot comment on its reliability or durability beyond that."
"Love this model.  All k cups work.  Works well and coffee is hot.  I am very happy with this model.  Easy to use.You might want to try this 0 Calorie Enzo Organic Stevia Powder I found, it's 320 times Sweeter Than Sugar plus it's all Natural"
"takes a minute to heat up, so if you are looking for a quick cup in the morning before hitting the road for work...keep that in mind. Make sure you have enough water in the well, because when you think it's ready and your'e ready to go, the ""add water light "" comes on....and it sets you back a bit, but it's all good...just put extra water in and your'e good. The coffee comes out hot..."
"I got this for my wife (a coffee drinker) as a Christmas present.  She loves it and uses it at least once a day.  Every cup now comes out perfect,and she doesn't have to make a half pot or whole pot to do it.  I was afraid it might end up as one of those things you buy, use a couple of times,  and forget about.  It has not.  I believe that in the two months (62 days) since she received it, it has been used well over a hundred times.  Various coffees, decaf coffees for guests, cappuccino, hot chocolate - it has done them all.  Maybe next tey will invent Ramen for K-Cup."
"I've never owned a Keurig coffee maker -- until now.  Makes a great cup of coffee and very consistent.  This particular model does have all the  ""bells and whistles"" as the larger units just a basic unit, but very easy to use. The water reservoir hold enough water for several good cups of coffee.Excellent value for the money, highly recommended!"
"Ok  what's the fuss I just don't get it the coffee pods are crazy expensive and you need at least 2 pods to get a good size cup of coffee if you use a large cup otherwise its coffee flavored water.1st you have to buy the best coffee for the best  results at about $1.00 a pod,2 you have to make it small if you want a good cup you'll need another pod to make a good cup of coffee To get a 16oz  cup and it is good and should be for a $2.00 in Home cup of coffee than I read that you can buy a resuseable pod and make your own cup isn't that the same as a regular coffee maker.I did the math comes out to about $30 a pound to use this machine with a regular coffee maker you can buy Starbucks for about $10 a pound and make a delicious cup of coffee . In conclusion the machine works great and fast only buy good coffee enjoy instant hot water and be ready to spend $20.00 a week to have a Keurig experience.Oh I forgot some of the pods can be duds.Update,I got use to the Keurig and found some good deals on the pods a 8oz cup one pod is about .50 a cup not all that bad  may have overreacted at first but once I shopped around and found some inexpensive pods i really starting to enjoy the machine the convenience factor is amazing and this particular model is made very well .So you may ask why only three stars well  it's because after a month of use the reservoir started to  leak once you start useing the Keurig the 40 oz  reservoir seems small so I returned it and got one with a bigger  80oz  reservoir may be if you don't have to refill it as often  you to reduce the wear and tear on the water plastic reservoir didn't crack the one I would place it in the machine when the machine warmed up  The reservoir leaked  anyway I sent it back and got a bigger one this particular model is a quality product for minimal use"
"Just don't do it. 2 months after purchase and use about 3 times a day...on a busy day...it has started acting up. We only use filtered water and according to the many help sites, clogging is the most common problem...don't see how that happens with an internal filter AND filtered water. Just stops working. Save yourself the bucks and aggravation. So disappointing."
"We had a K250. The coffee was always warm with high maintenance. It finally stated dumping g a lot of grounds in every cup. We had so many K Cups we had to get another machine. This was top rated on Amazon and it is. Very hot coffee every time, minimal maintenance, like no rinsing after a cup of tea. This makes a great cup of coffee with ease."
"I love my Keurig! It's easy to use, makes great coffee and since I use distilled water in it, it seldom if ever needs cleaning. I like to have one cup of coffee in the evening so the Keurig is the answer to that versus having to figure out on my other coffee pot how to brew just one or two cups. This Keurig will use any k-cups which is also nice as I read other reviews on different, newer Keurigs where they would only accept Keurig k-cups."
"top Quality coffee maker, if the machine is not clean it will not function properly. clean once a month in order to keep the make in an active state."
it works well as any other Keurig. One item that seasonal campers in northern climates might want to know......This item cannot be left in a camper over winter as it has an internal tank that will freeze and damage machine of course. you either have to research draining the unit and adding a little bit of RV antifreeze then completely purge it when brought back into service OR...just bring into a non freeze environment for winter etc. Either way you should purge unit internal tank b/c of bacteria growth etc.
This is my third cure. I got the small one first that you had to pour water in for each cup and loved it. Nothing was wrong with it but I wanted a bigger model that had a water reservoir. I wore it out after about 3 1/2 years of daily use. I ordered this one as it look like my old one. However it does not have a programmable timer and clock . I am sure if I'd read the product specifications closer it would've said that but I did not read it well enough. Still I love it. I have not used director coffee pot since my first Keurig.
"This is the third Keurig K55 we have had.  We like its look, the coffee it produces, and the ease of use.  Unfortunately, they do not last.  The first K 55 died after a year . . . OK, we thought we'd try another.  It lasted six months . . . still thought that was a fluke.  So, we tried a third--it lasted two WEEKS!  No more Keurig K55s for us!"
"I bought this K55 as a cost-effective replacement for an older B60 unit, and I'm quite pleased.  The K55 has plastic in places where my old B60 had chrome plated steel, but parts like the drip tray are interchangeable so I was able to use the best of both models.  This unit has no ""official K-cup"" foil lid sensor like the Keurig 2.0 models, so it accepts 3rd party pods like Trader Joe's without a hitch.  I can't say how long this unit will last, but so far I'm very pleased with it and would recommend it to anyone who doesn't need useless bells and whistles."
Excellent Product!!! Easy to clean and to use. Had the product at the office for several years and is used by 20 people daily so it has excellent reliability and durability
Bought this two days before delivery. Great service. It's replacing the same model different series Keurig I ran into the ground over a 5 year period.I'm O K with that . It served me well . The new one arrived today on a Sunday . Amazing . I unboxed it . Plugged it in and ran a couple of cups of water thru it to clean out any debris . Made a cup of coffee and it's off to the races again . Amazing.
"Works great.  I had a Mister Coffee Keurig brewer - it was about half the price at the time I purchased it.  It made okay coffee.  The Keurig K55 brews hotter, the coffee tastes better, and you get 3 size selections.  I was able to get it on sale which was the icing on the cake.  I'm glad I made the switch!"
"It seems Keurigs only last about two years in our house. This is our third and it seems cheaper in quality than the last two. It still makes a great cup of coffee, just doesn't seem as well made. My main complaint is the K-cup holder doesn't stay open; the old one would lock open. It also doesn't have the auto start feature, but it gets to temp really quickly, so it's not a big deal."
"Have had this for two weeks and my coffee doesn't taste right after brewing. Not sure what to do. Sadly, my original keurig broke and i had to replace it. If this problem doesn't resolve then I'm done with keurig. On my 2nd Keurig and now this one won't brew!!! Return window is closed. My original keurig lasted 9 years and I've gone through 2 of these in 3 months."
"This is the third Keurig K55 I've purchased in 2 months! I thought maybe I got a bad one. Then the second one was just as bad. The third was the worst! Keurig makes  warm, awful coffee. Customer service says the coffee is brewed at 160*. Mine were 140* at best. They also recommended I don't use my ""ice cold"" drop of milk. Each worked  for less than a week then nothing comes out! I'm done with Keurigs. I also believe Amazon refurbishes these coffee makers and sends them out as replacements. One of them had no wrapping whatsoever and had a used kcup in the dispenser!  I think the 4 and 5 star ratings are from people who were given free K55's. Total BS, I can't imagine how anyone can love bath water coffee, or in some cases, no coffee at all. Third one going back today. So done with Keurig ??"
I bought this coffee maker in May 2016.  Stop working today - 18 months later.  My previous Keurig with all the bells and whistles lasted a year.  That's it for me.  Going back to filter coffee makers.  My neighbor said Keurig is known to only last a year due to a problem they know about.  This of course is hear say.  I am here to tell you don't expect these machines to last long.
"This was to replace a K40 Elite.  Although it has most of the same features, they aren't exactly the same.  This has an added ""espresso"" size option.  I'm dropping a star only because of the water needed notice.  On the K40, the ""water needed"" indicator would light up as soon as the water level dropped below the amount needed for the next cup.  On this one, the light doesn't show up until you've pressed the button selecting your size.  It's not a deal breaker for me, but irritating.On the plus side, it doesn't require Keurig K-Cup coffee pods so you can use your own brand/flavor in the re-usable ones."
Bought this as a replacement for our older office coffee maker. With routine cleaning and timely filter changes I expect it to last much longer than our other one. Coffee tastes fresh every brew.
I just got my keurig k55 coffee maker today and I love it. There was a slight adjustment to figure out the coffee mug size but I did it.I hear of so many people having trouble with their coffee makers. I  hope I'm not going to be one of them. The only drawback is that ituses a lot of water but water is cheap. I got the drawer that the coffee maker sits on. I'm so proud of my keurig. I hope everyone is in the same boat as I am.
"Keurig has taken a giant step backwards in the quality of their coffee maker.  I had a previous model that began having issues with completing the water heating and dispensing cycle (after less than a year).  Foolishly I order the newer current model to replace it, and it was a great disappointment.  The handle attachment is now two visible screws and what appears to be a couple of washers through the sides of the handle, and the fit and finish of the other components was loose and cheap.  I'm debating returning this due to the fact it does not look like the pictures, although the larger reason is the fact that their materials and manufacturing are as cheap as I've seen.I won't be buying another Keurig.  There are much better quality machines available."
"I've got a few of these. I wanted this one to not have the clock settings, etc. because I use it at work and that would just get in the way. But, I find with this one the mechanism you close over the coffee insert doesn't seem to close well. Several times a weeks I have to hold the lever down to engage the sensors and have it spit out coffee. Might just be mine, but this is a little disappointing."
"A reluctant Home/Office Barista - when it comes to Home/Office coffee making, I go with a single-serve machine that is fast, simple to operate and makes Excellent Java.Today, I’m reviewing the Keurig K55 Coffee maker, while comparing it to my most recently deceased K145 OfficePRO commercial brewer, so hold on to your coffee jug.Also, at the end, I will share with you on 'How To Bling Your K55'! See Photo's.For anyone that brews 1 or x-number of cups a day, be coffee or tea, the Keurig Brewing system is both excellent in function and economical. It uses the Regular K-cups, which are available via different brands/flavors, including StarBucks, Costco/Kirkland, GreenMountain, Peets and many others:1. Fast Brew & Simple to use - no measuring, no clean up.2. No Waste - no burned coffee or going stale.3. Selector Mode in precise 6, 8 & 10 ounce cup sizes. Travel cups included.4. Option to use a Reusable/Refillable Filter Cup, for using your own brew.5. Offers a variety of Branded roasts and flavors.6. Can use a 4-cup carafe also.Con’s - Compared with my previous ‘K145 OfficePRO’ model, this K55 model is not to be expected with service for longer than 2 to 3 years, depending on Daily use patterns. My previous K145 OfficePRO model lasted a good 5+ years, of daily, heavy use.* The K55 is completely Plastic, except for the internal steel water tank & pump.* Button Controls are arranged the same as the K145, but does NOT have a Selector, which I liked better, because I could just leave it “set” on a Brew Size permanently. On this one, it’s the last step, after loading the K-cup.How to BLING your K55 Coffee maker - See Photos - Since the K145 and the K55 are almost the same model (except for some upgrades for the K145), I Re-Cycled some Parts, and you can do this too:1. I re-used the Chrome steel Cover from the K145, on the new Drip Tray.2. I re-used the Silver-colored Water Reservoir Cover, from the K145.3. I replaced the flimsy, gray plastic front handle on the K-cup Loader, with the K145 Chrome steel one.4. So if you can find a defective or discarded K145 OfficePRO model, then you can Bling your new K55, for almost nothing.5. Bonus - the Waters Reservoirs are exactly the same too. Keep the extra one handy to use for running a cleaning solution through, or as a backup!Updates - I will update this critter within 120 days, if anything of value is noteworthy, or I feel that a 5-Star Rating is earned."
Ordered this as we were having company stay from out of town and thought it would be convenient for them to use.  One less thing to worry about....well after having it for a bit I started using it for my tea too  Really enjoy using this coffee maker as I feel like I have a treat each morning. The only issue we had with it was that it was saying we needed to add water.  I saw this is a regular problem with these makers.  We learned how to reset the computer and haven't had any other problems.  We also do not take the container off the maker anymore we just fill it being attached.
"I really enjoy coffe and I usually enjoy it in large amounts. I was against buying a keurig for ages because I love the option of making coffee for a crowd with my drip coffee carafe. I finally broke down and bought this and I'm in love. I thought I would just use it occasionally in adjunct to my old coffee pot, but I have found that I use the keurig more and more and the drip pot less and less."
Previous Keurig worked great and for a long time. This one pumps vey slow and not always accurate in volume amount. Really a 2 1/2 stars.
"My wife and I bought two of these, one as a gift for my grandmother and the other for us. My grandmother's worked fine but ours seemed to have some type of unexplained power issue. It worked but I was afraid something wasn't right and didn't want to risk it. Turns out I waited too long... We were past Amazon's return date. The only thing I could do was try Keurig support. I was afraid I'd have to spend hours on the phone trying to get help but that wasn't the case at all. I immediately had a real person on the line and it only took 15 minutes. The customer service rep determined the unit was faulty and offered to send us a replacement for free. It arrived 4 days later and worked perfectly. Awesome!"
"This is by far the best Keurig. We had previously bought a K475 or a K575 and it was terrible. The touch screen would sometimes work. It was very loud and it would take at least 5 minutes to heat up to start brewing and then once it did heat up, since the screen rarely worked I could press the cup size to brew. And I had only owned it for less than 24hrs. But the K55 Keurig is simple, works great, its not loud. And I have coffee in less than a minute. My parents have had theirs for over 4yrs and it still looks and works like its brand new. Plus the tray at the bottom is removable so you can fit tumblers. I can fit a starbucks tumbler in under there with a little bit of extra room too."
The jury is still out on this. Hopefully it works like it should. Had trouble once already in brewing a quarter cup.  Had to clean needle already only a month old. First one lasted a long time but started acting up and cleaning didn't help it was recycled.  Bought a extended warranty and save box hopefully I don't half to return.  Two months later it doesn't work
"Our ""old"" Keurig bit the dust, and I immediately bought this one.  Prior experience with the 2.0 wasn't so good because it required proprietary K cups...and balked at making coffee with ""store brand"".  So I wanted a coffee maker that would just do the job like it's supposed to...and I bought a reusable K cup for brewing with regular coffee.  This coffee maker works well, and I purchased another one as a gift for a friend.  I would buy it again."
Works great and functions as expected. I have purchase several of these as gifts and everyone that has gotten one has absolutely loved it! Keurig takes all the hassle out of brewing a cup of coffee. No need to worry about grinding beans or flimsy filters. The simple 3 buttons makes this really easy to use and understand. If you are looking to get into the Keurig system this is a great brewer to go with. It won't do the big pots of coffee so you will have to go with a different model if that is the route you want to go down.
"I purchased this 5 months ago for use in our office. It's used daily, probably 2-5 times each day, and has remained just as functional and efficient as the day it arrived. The water reservoir needs to be refilled after about 3 mugs of coffee, so we put it near our water source for easy refilling. It is speedy and coffee is always a perfect hot temperature. Would definitely purchase again if needed"
"What a cool machine.  Ready to brew a second cup in 10 seconds.Pros:Lovely, easy, fast, reliable and clear indicators.Cons:You must keep enough water in the reservoir for 2 even if you don't want 2.  And, so far I cannot get my coffee strong enough and sometimes when I pour my vanilla inter'l coffee creamer in, I reheat my cup for 20 seconds because it cools it down.I love the Green Mtn pods that came with it, so I bought a box of 7 at grocery for convenience.  But, I like Folgers and I bought Java Cup 4 pack of reusable filters.  It is a bit loud but I don't care."
"I replaced a Mr. Coffee machine (which served me very well for years) with this model. I like how quiet the motor is, as well as the simple button selection of the controls.  My previous machine started leaking (after 4 years of heavy use), which I attributed to our very hard water here in Los Angeles.  The Keurig K55 comes with a small charcoal water filter fitted directly over the intake valve in the water tank.  The coffee tastes better due to this simple little filter.  It also brews a lot hotter coffee, which, I assume also contributes to the better coffee taste over the Mr. Coffee unit.  I am very pleased with this model."
"Lasted 3 months.  Unable to make a single cup of coffee now (appears to be level sense failure - unit saying ""add water"" when water reservoir is full).  Have power cycled multiple times, remove and replaced water reservoir several times.Prior unit was fantastic (4 year life).  Keurig like too many companies focused on cost reductions ....Will contact Keurig for replacement unit."
"I bought this and it was working fine and in 6 months the machine stopped moving the choice of small, med, large cup level. In fact it only let out about one inch of coffee-which did not taste good. I did a number of things-unplugged it, changed the water, on/off switch, shook it.....twice I got a cup of coffee that was a full cup. Tried again, no luck. The water heater also stopped lighting up-so I assume that is also a bomb.Also, in the beginning, when I did get a full cup, it was not that warm. I had to warm up my milk and sometimes the whole cup in order to get a hot cup of coffee.  Plus, if you have company it's not good to be making one cup at a time. I have now bought an italian coffee pot, which I put on the good ol' stove-I get fresh, hot coffee-the best."
"My new black K55 arrived today and the test drive was fine.  It's replacing my K45 that I tossed before learning about the paper-clip-in-the-needle trick.  I'm questioning what's so ""new"" about the K55, though, other than the ""cool"" graphics change on the all important letter ""K"" on the front.  The metal plate on the bottom of my old K45 is stamped ""Model K40.""  The metal plate on the bottom of my brand new K55 is likewise stamped ""Model K40.""  So the mechanical/electrical innards are the same, only cosmetic changes were made?"
"This is the second Keurig that I've purchased from Amazon. After 6 weeks it doesn't work. The motor respondes and seems to want to start the brewing then all lights come on and it stops.  I make one cup of coffee during the week and 2 on weekends, so it's not overworked. We have  one at the office that is working all day, without fail, and it was purchased at Costco. I'm working during if it's in the shopping, that it gets jostled around and damaged.  I did not send in the warranty so I'm screwed. If I go with another Keurig I'll purchase it at Costco."
"I am very dissatisfied with this Keurig.  I researched the different models and spoke with friends about their satisfaction with the Keurig model they owned.  After a lot of research and thought I chose the Keurig K55. Maybe I got a lemon,  but this thing is a piece of junk in my opinion.  I have not made a ton of cups with if because I've been away from home a lot.  But my experience is that it will brew one cup OK,  but the next ""cup"" ends up being about 1/4 the size of the first (using the same cup size selection on the machine. So I have to brew  3 or 4 times to get the same cup I got in the beginning.  Very frustrating!!!! I suppose I need to talk with someone & box the thing back up and return it. Two stars because it does make a tasty cup of coffee when it finally brews."
"I wanted to like this but from the first use, I noticed it does makes a loud noise, specially when heating the water. I have a friend that has one and it doesn't make loud noise. This one also leaked water when dispensing the coffee, I followed all the instructions. The coffee is not strong enough, if you use your own coffee in the refillable  cups, it comes out very watery/light, it leaks water into it so the coffee brewed lacks flavor. Due to noise and leakage is going back, sad because I wanted it to work."
"On my second one and AGAIN, my pump is going bad, I use a new filter every three months. I may have used it a year, very limited life.Would love to know a good alternative."
"Buying a Keurig 2.0 would be a poor choice. They break, they're picky, and they just aren't as good. I've had four 2.0 models,most of them were the top tier model, but I always had issues. The needles clogged, the coffee wouldn't stop ""dripping"", I wouldn't get the normal amount of water (sometimes only half a cup...), etc etc. They also didn't allow the filter cups that you pour your own coffee in. How sad. So my boyfriend got this one and it's great. It has never clogged, never dripped for longer than 5 seconds, never froze on him, and always given him a perfect cup of coffee."
"Had less than four months and it quit pumping water! Have extended warranty and trying to figure out how to retur, replace or get refund. Itbis second Keurig I bought. The first one lasted two years before it died."
Stopped working at 6 months.
"I cannot believe this product is rated so high by so many people.  That's why I gave it two chances... but both time the machine stopped working after 2-3 cups of coffee.  That's it.  In speaking with several friends that have this same Keurig, those that purchased it through Amazon had similar experiences.  Those that purchased elsewhere had 50/50 chance of it working out.  Not sure if the problem lies with where Amazon gets them... but all I know is I ordered two of this identical machines and both had the same issue. Cleaned properly.  Only used Keurig pods.  Still nothing.  And then to return the product and get charged a ""restocking fee"" is ridiculous.  This is the first time I've had this terrible of an experience with Amazon but it's highly frustrating.  I definitely do not recommend this product."
"I will never go back to a ""regular"" coffee maker. The variety of k-cups available alone makes this worth it. I got this for less than $100 and it was so worth it. I use it multiple times per day. Never had a bad cup of coffee! I love that it came with a few k-cups to sample. Because of that I've ordered the Donut Shop and Swiss Miss k-cups. The latter is wonderful in the winter, and Amazon has great add-on prices for it as well."
"Awesome coffee maker! Holds a good amount of water - enough for a few cups. Water heats up quick. Tall mugs or cups don't fit unless you take the bottom off, but it just slides and the cup will fit. I got a bunch of off brand k-cups and they work perfectly."
"The coffee is a bit light, and not hot enough. However, it is the fastest, cleanest, easiest, cheapest, and most convenient way to get my coffee and tea in. I am a teacher... I make coffee all day even in the middle of teaching!!I use reusable k cups so it's cheap. My coffe last forever because only a small amount of grounds are needed.I place tea bags straight in the reusable k cups. And loose leaf green tea just has to be placed in the k cups, and rinsed till wet before using it.My last one lasted 7 years"
"Often when I use it, it only brews just a little bit of coffee. I read the instruction guide and followed the instructions on what to do if it only brews a partial cup, but continues to give me problems. Any suggestions?"
This even came with a complimentary 4 pack of coffee and hot chocolate.  Totally impressed with it as it also has a feature that allows you to fill travel mugs by removing a platform.
The first Keurig machine is almost exactly like the K55 with 1 more cup size.  Our first machine was getting slow because of water hardness build up after six years so we ordered this new one.  It arrived on time in good condition and is as we expected for a new Keurig coffee maker.  I would recommend this to anyone who just likes a good fresh cup of Java.UPDATE:The Keurig that we received was defective.  The top load mechanism would not stay open to receive a pod.  The water did not heat to a proper temperature.  We would get 155 F. water from the first cup in the morning.  After heating the coffee cup by cycling the machine 4 or 5 times we would get up to 168 F.  This also warmed the machine up which would not soak the heat from the water.  We called Keurig and they sent us a new machine.  We tested the new machine for water temperature and it would get up to 185 F. after cycling 5 cups and warming up the coffee cup.  The web site explained that the temperature setting is set to 192 F. and a good cup of coffee needs from 180 to 195 F.  My advice is to test the machine with a candy thermometer like we did to be sure you get hot water.
"There's nothing I can say about the Keurig that hasn't been said by other reviewers.  What I will say is that my wife and i absolutely love this product and highly recommend it to any coffee/hot cocoa lovers.  It is very easy to use and makes brewing coffee or cocoa so much easier.  My only regret is not buying this earlier  Now that I own a Keurig, I am hooked on the ease of my morning coffee experience!"
"Great coffee, great machine. Wish it had a larger reservoir because we end up filling it every day as my wife and I both fill large thermos bottles in the morning and that's a pain so I docked a star. Other than that I'm very happy with it. It's my first k cup machine and the coffee is fantastic"
"Have been using this for almost 6 months now. Works great. Bought and tried many brands of coffee, to narrow down to what we likeRemoved one star because I think it would have been better (for right handed folks) to have the water tank on the right. It's difficult to fill the tank without spilling on the left side, especially if the coffee filter is up.This has mostly replaced both my filter and expresso coffee machines."
"The first one was ok lasted a few years, the second one only lasted a few months, the third one didn't last even that.  I am fed up. However I did insure the last one.  I really don't know if I want to get another .Any suggestions?  Yes, mine clogged at the needle after a couple of months.  Upon reading the reviews I think I found the answer.  The needle is clogged and you have to unclog it with a paper clip.  It worked.  We will see how long this lasts.  Thanks for the unclogging suggestion as I do love this machine."
"This machine is a replacement for my original Keurig of the same model. This new machine brews the same, providing my three or four cups of joe for the day, and it seems to do the job a bit faster than my original unit. Functionally it is fine, but if it were a car, one might describe the ""fit and finish"" as diminished from the original -- just looks and feels a little bit cheaper. No bigs I guess, just something that makes you go ""hmmm"". I am particular about such things, so consider the source as well."
"I purchased this as a gift for my Son in November 2016 and he brought it to me this weekend (almost 5 months later) and he said it worked about 3 times and quit.  My husband and I looked at it and couldn't get it to work.  It powers on, heats the water, accepts the POD, the lights blink on the different cup sizes, and then after you select the cup size it clicks approx. 3 times and quits.  I don't think the pump is pulling/pushing the water from the water tank to the machine.  Very disappointed.  I have had the same coffee maker for several years and it works great."
"I wasn't sure how I would feel about the K-cups. I have resisted buying a coffee maker like this for years, thinking that I wouldn't use it enough or that the K-cups were too expensive. I don't like brewing a huge pot of coffee that just gets cold and stale. This is my first Keurig machine and I am very satisfied. Time will tell if I end up using it every day or just a few times a week. Either way, I am happy with the purchase price and the functionality of the machine. It's not super loud when brewing and very easy to clean and maintain. Definitely happy with my purchase."
Purchased this as a gift for my parents to replace their old non working until. Arrived promptly and in good condition. It's been in operation for 5 months now with no issues I'm aware of. Maybe I need to call my parents more often. Just joking. They love it and I would order again.
Love the Keuig K55 Coffee Maker. My only problem is deciding which K-Cup to buy more of.
"This is my 2nd Keurig, the first one finally gave it up. There are some features with the new one that I like, and some that I preferred on the older model.  I like the water filter, and the ability to 'descale' this one. I also like the feature that automatically turns the unit off 2 hours after the last cup has been brewed.  I am the only one using it so after my 2 morning cups it shuts down, nice.  The previous one had a light in the water tank that alerted you to refill, this one has an indicator that comes on only after you have pressed the brew button, if you are paying close attention it will sit there until you realize the water level is low.I recommend this to anyone who enjoys a good cup of coffee, of course that depends on which 'Kcups' you choose, and doesn't want to brew an entire pot."
"Bought this Keurig for 3 main reasons: convenience, price, and size. I was previously using a French press to make my coffee in the mornings, but grew tired of how long it took to make my daily coffee and found myself always rushing through the morning. This Keurig has made my morning much less rushed, saving me a lot of time. It warms the water up and brews the coffee from the K-cup pod quickly (probably around 3-5 minutes). It also seemed the most reasonably priced. I also chose it because it seems to take less space than other Keurigs, but it also brews only one serving per brew (so that's a trade-off). As I share a house with others and our kitchen isn't the biggest, having a Keurig that didn't take up too much space was something I needed.A plus that I didn't really think about when I bought it was that I can use it to make tea as well. So, in the mornings I make coffee, and in the evenings when I'm back from work, I use it to make tea so I can relax.Not only has it given me more time in the mornings, but it has also saved me a good amount of money from not having to go to coffee shops. I have been using this Keurig for about 3 months now, and am so far very happy with the purchase!"
"I bought this Keurig for my daughter, she would not stop talking about wanting one. She loves it. She made the kids a cup of hot cocoa and the little one who is 4 told her mom that that was her machine and if she wants to use it just ask. Ha ha.  I have owned one for 3 years. I love this Keurig. It will take any K cups which is nice. You can also use it when you need a cup of hot water for a recipe. I love it. If you like any hot beverage and want a special treat you wont be sorry buying this item."
"I've owned this devise approximately 7 months and as of the first of January it works whenever it feels like and even if it decides to fill the cup to the level you request, you may have to take a trip around the block while you wait for it.  I'm not expecting perfection, but a little reliability on a fairly new devise is reasonable.  It's about the hit the junk pile - how are you supposed to fix something like this?  I would discourage anyone from putting good money towards this item."
"Received as a Valentine's gift, lots better than flowers. Works wonderfully and is opening up a whole new world on our coffee enjoyment."
"This was a replacement for my husband's first machine, which he had for about five years. After not quite 18 months, the new one seems to have died as well. Since he's the only one that uses it, it hasn't had heavy use and he's good about cleaning it. I'm thinking it may be time to try another brand now since Keurig seems not to be a reliable choice."
"Item was received as promised. K55 has a plastic handle as opposed to the metal handle on the older K50.  Water chamber does not light up in led blue like the old K50.  Other than the cheap downgrades, this coffee maker functions like the old model and seems to be a good replacement.  The K 55  has a charcoal water filter that is good for 3 months.  Our last keurig did not have any water filtration. I think the filter may help keep the coffee maker pump (the part that fails) running longer. We have had keurig coffee makers in our house for over 15 years.  We have come to the conclusion that they fail to work around the 4th year no matter what model you choose.  The same holds true for the ones we purchae for the office as well as the keurig machines we keep at my parents and in law house.  Basically I purchase 3 machines every 5 years for all 4 locations.  Why have I bought 12 coffee makers?  I continue to do this because k cups are the fastest , freshest way to brew a single cup of coffee.  Enjoy the quick cup of coffee but do not expect any keurig machine to last more than 4 years without replacement.Lee"
"I love this Keurig coffee maker. It works as describes and the coffee is brewed deliciously! It is so convenient, too. I have to fill the water reservoir almost daily but I'd rather do that then use stale water. Works like a charm!"
"Very disappointed with this product. It has not worked correctly and consistently. Called the support team and they told me to clean the machine. I had it less than 1 month using filtered water and it requires cleaning? I cleaned it as they said, next day it is not working again. Some days it will work and some days it wont. I had to go back to my old drip coffee maker to have my morning cup. I do not recommend this product. Ether try a different model or a different product but pass on the K55."
"This is our third Keurig coffeemaker.  My coffee in this new one has a horrendous plastic taste.  I've tried several water reservoirs full and same thing, terrible taste.  I checked comments for same issue and yes, there is an issue.My 2 other Keurigs are fine.  I do not use the filter in them.  I use only spring water and never had a problem.  Hmm....wonder if it's the charcoal filter?  Anyway, not for me to figure out.  It is going back."
"I purchased this coffee maker on January 1, 2017. For the first month I loved the coffee and the speed of brewing. Slowly the speed of brewing has declined and now, 6 months later, it is pathetic how long it takes to brew. It sounds like the pump is about to expire.  I have searched thru the Amazon website to resolve this matter, but I guess the replacement policy is good for only 30 days. Disclaimer: I have owned Keurigs since they first came out and have never had this problem. ."
"Bought this to replace my old single-serve Keurig.  Definitely like this one a lot more.  What is there to say? It makes great coffee easily and HOT.For those who buy this, make sure you register yours online.  Keurig gives you a promo code for 50% off all K-cups on their website.  I bought 4 boxes of my favorites at much better prices than in a store."
"This machine hardly works. We had bought 1 and it stopped working right at the return time frame. We were told we did not have to return the broken one...they sent a ""new"" one that also does not work. And now they are asking for the original 1st broken one back....Neither of them work. WATER DRIPS THROUGH IN TINY DROPS. BARELY FILLS ONE CUP. HAVE TO RUN IT MULTIPLE TIMES TO GET ONE CUP OF COFFEE."
"It's the same one I had over 5 years ago but they replaced the silver plastic with all black.  No more blue light inside the water container.  But for the price, it's perfect."
"First time buying this type of coffee maker and because it's just me I like it.  But I have attempted to buy a reusable filter several times without any luck.  Bought 2 at local stores and one of them fit but was terrible and poorly made, 2nd one from store didn't fit this type of Keurig. Bought 2 from Amazon and they too were wrong ""type.""  Need help with purchasing right type.  If this coffee maker doesn't have a reusable filter I'll probably return it.  Don't want to have to buy all those ""pods !"""
Mom loves it.  She is in her late 80's and the regular coffee pot had become too heavy for her to fill and lift. This has been perfect.  Easy to fill with just a cup and is so much less messy.  No more spilled coffee grounds on the floor and no more day old coffee being thrown out.
"Have had this type Keurig for years, replaced it 3 times now- they don't last forever especially when you use it everyday like we do.  But I love it.  The price is reasonable the product works.  It's a great standby.  We tried a larger, fancier version and ended up returning it because of the noise and some other features which weren't great."
"I absolutely love the Keurigs! They are the best coffee makers, and are so easy to use. The only one thing I don't like about Keurig is that they only last about a year and then you have to buy a new one. Even though they only last about a year, I love them so much that I will continue to buy them!"
"We have gone through a number of Keurig coffee makers over the years.  Keurig, Cuisinart, and others.  Many have eventually failed, or become extremely loud for some reason.This one is smaller than previous models, but is extremely quiet, and functions very well.  Coffee is brewed identically, cup to cup, and we now look forward to making the first cup in the morning...rather than gritting our teeth, hoping to not wake up the kid.Well made, and easy to use. Simple controls and reliable. Recommended."
"Excellent product. This is our 2nd one and we love it. Fast and easy. Can switch between coffee and tea without worries about cross-flow. Read some complaints about it not being hot enough. It is perfect for me. Yes, my wife likes it a bit hotter, so 20 seconds in the microwave and we are ready to go."
"Terrible, broke after one week (stopped pulling water through the system) thank heaven for the ease and zero hassle of amazon returns, I had even thrown away the box. I love the single brew idea just wish Keurig would make better products (my first keurig broke after just a year which doesn't seem worth it for the high expense of these)"
"Every single cup of coffee smells and tastes like plastic. I followed all of the troubleshooting recommendations, nothing worked. I tried white vinegar, it did not stop the plastic taste. I ran 12 tanks of water through the machine, it did not stop the plastic taste. I searched online for help only to discover that this is an extremely common problem. It has been returned to Amazon for a full refund."
"My Keurig I had for going on four years died and I went on a search for a new one. After much thought and reading many reviews I decided against the new Keurig 2.0 and went back old school. I kept reading reviews about people having problems with the 2.0 not reading even the approved Keurig k cups so I decided against it. I like that you can use any k cups in the original Keurig. So far no complaints except when you lift the lid to put the pod in it doesn't stay up like it should, it just kinda slides back down. Not a deal breaker but also not a reason to send it back. My old model also didn't have the auto shut off and water filter so those are a plus. I bought the warranty which was very cheap so now I don't have to worry about it lasting for at least four years!"
Fourth one we've purchased for various areas.  It's great for single cups of coffee or for multiple people to give them choices of flavor.  Recommend getting single serve coffee filter and also E-Z Cup Disposable filters so that you can use own coffee.  Saves a lot of money from the individual prepared containers.
"Works well. Bought this to replace our aging Keurig, which was the same model, but several year older that stopped working. Has worked well, but our old one started working again, so we use both when we need multiple cups of coffee at the same time. If this one lasts 3-4 years like our last one did, I'll be happy, We have very hard water where we live, so we don't expect super long life from any appliance that requires tap water."
"Our old Keurig died, so we bit the bullet and purchased this one. I miss the extra large setting for tall mugs. I work around this by running a pod twice, once on medium and once on small, which works well. It's minor annoyance that sometimes it doesn't say add water until brewing starts; my guess is that it doesn't know it needs water until the brew size is selected."
"I ordered this Keurig coffee maker to replace my first Keurig because I love the convenience of the fresh single cup of coffee.  This machine is a bit different than my older coffee maker but I like the new features of cup size choice and more compact design.  Because I'm the only coffee drinker in the family,  this appliance is perfect."
"Having had no experience with keurigs or other brewers, I can say the K55 seems quite sufficient.  There have been a few times it didn't seem to work quite right, making all the normal noises but nothing ever coming out.  I've found that usually removing the water tank and placing it back in position fixes this issue."
"This is my 4th Keurig coffee maker.  They are made in China.  Quality control is not part of their mfg process.  As a consequence, I get about 18 months of service from my Keurig coffee makers.  I stay with Keurig because I really like the simplicity/variety/quality of coffee I can make with the K-cups"
"I have been waiting for this for a long time. I finally got it on a cyber deal! After carefully reading all the reviews I decided on this model then I found in on Amazon for a steal! What's not to love?! Awesome purchase! Highly recommend to anyone! love the Keurig machine and the K Cups! what a awesome variety of coffee, tea, cocoa,cider, and even Iced tea and coffee.! I love the different sizes of cups and its programmable too! Thanks Amazon and Keurig!"
"It was the usual Keurig ... and the usual excellent shipment and delivery from Amazon.  Price was good too.PD a few days after I began using it, I had a problem with the area where the K cup rests for brewing... I had to clean it a few times to get it up and running.  Today same thing happened in the extra large cup maker area.  Mention this because the other machine I had for over 5 years with NO NaDA NOTHING happening till it died>>>>  I have a problem when products do not stand up to usual use."
Came packaged very nice & sturdy.  Easy to put together.  Gave as a Christmas gift to my father-in-law.  My daughter started making coffee as soon as he received it.  Love it!
"Update: I called Keurig support and it seems it was a quick and easy fix, requiring about 2 minutes and a paperclip. I found their customer support very helpful. I changed my star rating to a 4 simply because I'm not sure if the issue will return.I have to give our Keurig a low review because after only a little more than a month, it has stopped making a large cup of coffee. It starts to heat up the water and then makes a clicking noise and the lights flash. The low water indicator light comes on even though there is plenty of water. It is annoying to stand there waiting while making two small cups when you have two small kids running around!"
"Love this thing! I work from home and sometimes I just want that afternoon coffee but not an entire pot. This is perfect. And the assortment of coffees available is awesome, of course. What I didn't expect is how much I'd love the teas, hot cider, and hot cocoa. Highly recommend!"
I'm in love with my Keurig! I really enjoy this model over the original basic model. The filtered water is nice. You don't have to refill every single time you want a cup of joe. It has an alert light when you need to clean it. So you don't have to worry about mold and such. It's also nice to be able to pick the size of your cup. You choose whether you want a standard mug or enough to fill your thermos.  I have been very happy with my Keurig.
"Got this to replace our small one-cup Keurig.  We love it and wouldn't expect anything but the best from Keurig.  I really wish there were a few more colors at the same price (no idea why one color is more expensive than another, that's nuts), but black will do fine.  I just like bright and colorful small appliances."
"This product is terrible. I paid next day shipping to get it here for a breakfast meeting this morning that was important to my business. I was meticulous in unpacking it and it has no cleaning tool. The coffee dripped out and didn't even fill a large size mug and there's no cleaning tool in the packaging anywhere (not that I should even have to clean a brand new product!)  When I restarted it, the light sensors seem to freeze and I had to plug and unplug it and now water is leaking from somewhere I can't see, I had to leave my meeting to go get everyone coffee. There are several reviews that show the machine clogs and doesn't work - don't buy this product, it's a nightmare."
"This is just not a well-made machine. It is not consistent in brewing different sizes of coffee cups--sometimes the tea control works, sometimes not. Occasionally I can get it to brew a half-cup, but not often. We've had Keurig's for years, and this one is only 6 weeks old. Not a happy camper here. Am thinking of ditching the Keurig line totally and going to the Mixspresso brand, which is Italian made and can use Keurig cups."
Nice unit. Holds a large amount of water and heats water really fast. Has 3 coffee size settings but I only used LARGE or medium.  Also shuts off after couple hours of non-use. Water is pretty hot but I usually add 30 sec after brew is complete in microwave - like it REAL hot. I use it 2x a day for last 3 months with no problems....also use generic pods and generic different fine coffee.  No need to pay for keurig brand coffee.  Very happy so far.
It was great while it lasted. We didn't use it often...maybe a few times a week. It only lasted 1 year then died. If you don't mind replacing it every year then you are ok but if you want something that will last this isn't it.
This is April 2017.  I bought this K55 Brewer in Nov. 2016.  Had it 5 months and it is not working anymore.  Lights keep going on for warming and water and it has water.  Will not brew.  My 2nd Keurig.  First one still so-so but it was only the single one where you had to put one cup of water in on top and wanted a better machine.  Well this worked fine for 5 months and then poof.  Very disappointed.  For the price it should work a lot longer.
"After suffering through two Mr. Coffee single cup brewers (the second a free replacement for the first that tended to detonate k-cups all over the kitchen) I finally did some research and bought the Keurig K55.  It brews a hot, strong cup of coffee, quietly and reliably.  The water reservoir is easy to refill and the cup size options are very handy.  I wish I had bought this one to begin with."
"I'm enjoying my new Keurig - I just wish the cup sizes were a little bigger.  I wasn't expecting them to be so small, but I am getting used to it.  I have been wanting to get one of these for many years.  It works great and I would buy it all over again.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars, was because of the cup sizes."
"I've been debating buying a Keurig for a long time, and when this went on sale, I couldn't resist. I had heard that Keurig makes weak coffee, so I was worried because I love strong coffee. But I've had no problems. It works well, my coffee comes out hot. I like it. I use the middle cup setting (no idea what measurement it is) and it's not weak at all (I buy Donut Shop Dark). The hot chocolate I tried from it sucked though. That was weak. But this was easy to set up and easy to use. I can't complain."
This is my 3rd Keurig machine so obviously we love the convenience of using it by just putting in a coffee pod. Simple to use and easy to keep clean. The only reason the machine gets 4 stars instead of 5 is because the one problem I have noticed with all my Keurig's is the coffee never gets hot enough even when the temperature control is at its highest. After I make a cup I put it in the microwave for 20 seconds.
"My first keurig ever, and I'm inlove. I've had it since March & I use it for coffee, tea, hot chocolate, ect. When cleaning it does take a while (I used 1 part water and 1 part white vinegar). But it cleaned very well. I use my own reusable k cup for coffee because k cups get expensive, and I brew regular hot water into a coffee mug and use tea bags for my tea. Holds enough water for 4-5 regular sized cups. Everyone is updating to the new 2.0 but I will use this one until it craps the bed."
"This is my second purchase of the K55.  The machine lasts about six months with one, sometimes two users...combined with the cost of the k-cups, it's about the same as going to Starbucks.  Get a black & decker brew and go for $17.50 and use Folgers for a better cup of coffee at a way cheaper price."
"First time Keurig owner and like it a lot!  Much better than our other coffee makers. Really good for just 2 people and so many choices of coffee. I put  a small fishing floater in the water chamber to add water before getting the ""needs water"" light so didn't have to stop and add water. Only downside is the ""guilt"" for all the plastic waste. Will try the ""fill your own"" K-Cup option. Did buy the option for recycling standard cups, but didn't work."
"I bought this to replace an older Keurig model that I got a few years ago.  the older model got clogged up and all the descaling I did to it did not help.  So it was time for a new model.  The price has gone down on these, but so has the quality.  What was a metal drip tray and handle is now just more plastic.  It's also more noisy than my last one.  I still enjoy it, but minus 1-star for the ""cheaper"" quality."
"Love this coffee maker. We had a Starbucks Verismo originally and it quick working. I read several reviews on Keurig and decide to purchase. I'm so happy with my decision. The coffee, hot chocolate, and tea are nice and hot. We got assorted pack of K cups and love our options of the different blends they offer for this model. It has the option for assorted sizes of coffee, hot chocolate, or tea. Makes the drink quickly and easy to clean. I would recommend this product!! A++"
"Love this Keurig!  I bought this for family who was visiting that wants coffee in the morning.  They are normally fine going somewhere to pick up a cup, but I didn't want to make them leave in the snow.  I have been surprised how much I have been enjoying cider and herbal tea each day.  My husband uses his own hot chocolate mix and fills his mug up with the hot water.  The water is incredibly hot so it needs time to cool, but I would rather let it cool then have to heat it up."
"I was skeptical buying a Keurig because I have heard they need to be returned quite often but my husband insisted.  I bought this in Sept and it's now February and I really wish I didn't make this purchase.  It is a great machine when it works but it frequently has issues where it makes noise like it's drawing water and pouring but isn't doing anything.  I've had to ""reset"" it about 4 times and will be contacting keurig this week to exchange it.  If I could return it I would."
"I had the smaller version Keurig and it broke in less than 6 months.  I wanted to replace but read bad reviews about it, so stepped up to this version b/c it was on sale.  I am impressed so far.  It brews so fast and works great.  I did register it, so I could replace if needed, but so far I am impressed.  I love a Keurig!"
"This product is convenient.  Although I haven't found a brand of coffee I really like, it seems that everyone else has.Consider this - you will have to take a day off from work to descale it (recommended that this be done every three months.and it takes hours.)The Keurig descaling solution is around $11.00 on Amazon, and I really think you can make your own solution with vinegarand water."
Bought for my wife as a direct replacement for her previous machine (unsure of exact model number). Pros -Brews fast even when making multiple cups in a row for company and my wife makes quite a few a dayBuilt with great quality as most keurig products arethe water reserve is enough to make more then enough cups without constant refilling and comes off for fill when it needs to be refilled.Cons -The only con i found was the lack of digital screen in this version but i knew that buying it and thats just me being a tech geek
"Awful. First off it sounds like a plane is taking off the runway. I bought this one because the old one was fading and I figure a brand new one would do the trick. Man o man was I wrong! After its few minutes of sounding like you are on the tarmac, it spits out a little dribble of coffee. I am choosing the middle button and I get about 1-2 ozs of coffee.I could not be more disappointed in a product."
"We had a Keurig for almost 10 years before it died; we replaced it with this model.  This is not made as well, in my opinion: the handle is not metal, it's plastic and seems flimsy.  Also, the machine is NOISY!!!  It groans and moans.  Not real pleased with it.  :-("
"Have had Keurigs before and needed one for a vacation home.  This looks like the one I have but built much cheaper!  The handle is plastic, my other was metal.  The drip plate is plastic, my other is metal but more than that, the filter feature which I don't have on the one I own, didn't seem to allow the water to fill to the correct level.  When I removed it, the level of water was correct.  I hope this will last for a while but. To holding my breath.  I would not buy this one again."
"Dead in less than 6 months. It started with a cough. Joe Maker came out of the box looking very scrappy, but then started ""coughing"" out smaller and smaller amounts of coffee. I attempted descaling, but I had no luck. Poor, sad, wee thing, he just got worse. Early one morning, Mr. Maker took a turn for the worse and was gone before you could say ""Late for work."" Young Joe Maker's life was far too short by modern standards and now he rests in a landfill with his other poorly-crafted, disposable brethren. We all suffered, at the end.Joe Maker. Tis you, tis you must go and I must bide.On a more cheerful note, while shopping for a perkier perker, I discovered Mr. Coffee brand brewers that use K-Cups and cost between $40-$50.  Why pay more if they are only last 6 months?  Hurry before the hipsters surge to replace their Keurigs with this retro brand and the prices go up."
This was a replacement for a unit we had for 2 years.  I haven't had this unit 2 months and it is already acting up.  Not making full cups sometimes just making a lot of noise.
I had another Keurig that lasted a few years before dying and this one lasted less than a dozen cups of coffee before the pump went out. This model is great because it has a big reservoir but the water now just dribbles out instead of being pushed through the pod. Very disappointed in the quality of this one. Hopefully I can contact Keurig and they can help me with the issue I'm having.
"Works pretty good. Bought this for my mom, as she has trouble balancing a full carafe of coffee. This model has very simple button controls which is great for people who don't want to fight a computer when making a cup of coffee!Be careful shopping for K-cups, they can be pricey. When you find a coffee you really like you can usually get it cheaper by ordering in quantity. I still think it is cheaper to brew coffer the traditional way, but I have to say this thing makes a good cup of coffee fast and very conveniently."
Very disappointed. This Keurig stopped working only one month after purchase.  My previous Keurig lasted problem free for years. Has the quality gone down?
"I used this product for two months and it stopped working.  This is the second Keurig I've had but fortunately the first one worked longer.  I'm disappointed that there is no link whereby I can return this product.After I posted the above review, I got an email from their customer service asking me to call them.  I did and they walked me through how to clean the head of the unit and after doing that it works fine."
"If you're OK buying K-Cups, buy it. If you're thinking about using the reusable filters, get ready to buy K-Cups.None of the Keurig brand or after market self-brew filters make a cup of Joe worth a second look.  Coffee comes out weak; kind of like warm water mixed with a hint of more warm water. There's a dozen different hacks on line to get a stronger brew, but nothing's worked yet."
Excellent coffee pot - love the K-pod options ... just wish the large cup size actually filled the larger cups - other than that - excellent buy!
"Best cup of coffee I've had in awhile.  Acutally taste like I'm drinking speciality coffee from a resturaunt.  I just love it.  I was just going to use it when having guest or in the afternoons because of the cost but it was so good that I've been drinking it in the mourning and afternoon, and I had cut back alot because coffee hadn't been tasting that good lately.  I would definitely recommend this great cup of coffee."
"This is a great kcup coffee maker...I have used it at a friends house, and had to get one for work! I use the small cup setting most often because I like more bold coffee... I love it. It's quick and easy to use. The bottom tray comes out so a taller cup can be filled easier. No messy single use water filling with this machine. You can make multiple cups and it's easy to refill the side reservoir."
I love my new Keurig! I dont know how I ever lived without it. I bought the Keurug 5048 reusable cup too so that I can use my own coffee instead if K-Cups. I'll buy it again as a gift...Awesome!
This is my fourth Keurig.  Keurigs in general seem to burn out after a year or so.  I'd suggest manually turning them off when not using them.  I put it in my bedroom so I can have coffee ready as soon as possible.  The water reservoir simplifies things more than you'd imagine.I add a couple drops of chlorine bleach whenever I fill it to kill bacteria.  If you're not a bacteria you won't notice it.
"I reluctantly bought this Keurig model when my K70 fell apart. This one doesn't have the bells and whistles I had been accustomed to, but it works fine. My complaints are that the lid to the reservoir is not easy to get off and on, it does not hold as much water as my last model and that it does not yield the amount of liquid it should and I have to run it twice to get the amount of coffee I desire. Typically, I would expect this when a descaling is needed, but the machine is brand new. All of that being said, this is the only model available with a water reservoir and takes the original K cups, so I'm keeping it!"
Finally a brewer that brews all my K Cup regardless if Keurig brand.  I love my caramel cappuccino and now I can have them.  Yeah!!  A friend told me to get this as she has one and loves it too.  I learned the hard way that the 2.0s only used branded Keurig K Cups and nothing else.
"I'm a huge fan of this Keurig.  We bought this as an upgrade from a smaller version.  Primarily we wanted a water tank so we could make multiple cups without having to make a trip to the water purifier on our refrigerator.  I only have a few tips to consider...1. If you want a water tank as badly as we did, look for something a bit bigger if they offer it.  I find that I feel like i'm filling this thing up all the time.  I know it's not the case, but I want true lazy mode!2. Make sure you clean it per the instructions every few months, it makes a difference with it's performance."
"Consistent quality coffee and tee. The water sensor is great at not allowing a brew to start with not enough water to finish. It's easy to use and a decent size. It takes up a bit more counter space than I'd prefer, but that's the trade-off for the reservoir option. A good buy"
"I am loving my Keurig coffeemaker !  This is so much better for me that a standard type coffee maker.  I can make one cup at a time and with the filter I can use the coffee I like best.  I like the water tank that allows me to make several cups before refilling.  Sorry I waited so long to do an upgrade.UPDATE:  QVC has the same Keurig with extra coffee pods, filters ALL for the same price !!!!"
Nice sleek looking machine. Wish it held more water though. The two options for the amount of coffee you want doesn't really make much of a difference so I'm a little disappointed in that. Sometimes it doesn't brew all the way and I get a watery cup of coffee.  I don't know maybe mine is just messed up but I will probably get a different one later on.
"Works well, however, no control over amount of water to make a cup , you have 3 choices and the largest is just not enough to fill a large coffee cup. And some coffees are to strong . I also did not want the model above this for the restrictions of Kcups to use."
"Pretty good! I use it at work and once I found the right coffee, I love it.  I like it because it because the coffee will always be fresh as opposed to sitting in the carafe for an hour or two. Auto shut off is a plus."
"When I first received this Keurig K55 Coffee Maker, I absolutely LOVED this machine! The K55 takes ALL K Cups, so my family & I had been enjoying different ones.It initially was not loud and took a very short time to get a fresh brewed..FULL..cup of coffee, hot chocolate or tea.Unfortunately, that did not last long before we started having our first problems with this unit. I'd say about a month into owning it.  This Keurig would sometimes give a full cup of coffee, but not always. I initially thought we just needed to clean it out more, etc. We always ran a full, clear {no K Cup inserted} cycle through the maker to make sure there were no 'gunk"" building up after using hot chocolate, flavored coffees, etc. We did that without fail every single time we used the Keurig K55 Maker with flavored coffees, hot chocolate or tea.The machine started making a lot of noise like it was about to start brewing though nothing happened except loud noises. The noises continued to get louder as it was just the machine running. There was no water leaving the reservoir to even go into the machine to mix with the coffee. At first, we got almost half a cup of coffee {from the largest setting}. Then no coffee or water at all. . Just loud 'brewing"" machine noises that did nothing.I also kept finding water around the machine, but thought maybe someone spilt some while filling the reservoir. It was not that, but instead leaking. It got worse as time went on and just one more frustration of trying to use this machine.We're not heavy coffee, tea, or hot chocolate drinkers...so this machine was maybe used once a day on average for a month and a half. {It was used about 3 or 4 times a day the first week when everyone wanted to try it out}. For a $100 coffee machine this should have lasted a lot longer AND been able to easily make multiple cups of coffee/tea/hot chocolate a day for a lot longer than two months.This was our first and LAST Keurig Coffee Maker. Overpriced, plastic JUNK! Great 'idea' HORRIBLE product!"
"This is very simple to operate. There’s one power button, 3 buttons for cup sizes, and lights that indicate what’s happening during the brewing process. Features a 48 ounce removable reservoir - enough to make 6 standard cups and is super easy to refill. This is a classic series brewer so it’s compatible with all regular k-cups (branded and non-branded, with updated or old labels)."
"The reason I ordered this coffee pot was that it would accept all Kurig type cups.  Not all Kurig pots accept any brand but the Kurig brand.  This is easy to use - the only reason I gave it a ""four star"" is that the water reservoir is small."
My guilty pleasure. You can get the k55 for a decent price and all k cups work with it. I love having a variety to choose from in the morning.
"It is already not working! I went to make a cup of coffee after two months (one person, two cups a day) and the water will not go through the k-cup.  Everything seems to work fine, pumps the water, heats it up only comes out if you remove the k-cup.  I have cleaned all the pieces...not change."
"This is just like my original Keurig coffee pot, then another and then two more different versions!  Went back to the ""original"" and noticed it works a lot faster than the newer fancier versions.  So this one gets my vote!"
"My wife loves it! Arrived well packaged, with 2 filters and 4 sample pods. Easy to follow instructions walk you through assembly and use. Very happy with convenience factor. The tank holds enough water for numerous cups of coffee. Refills easily. We use filtered water to fill to avoid scaling. Heats promptly, and has gone through boxes of pods without a single issue."
Exactly as advertised.
"Using k cups are fine but not as strong as I prefer. Using fresh ground is a waste of time. Very weak. Bought 2 different types of holders for ground coffee, one of which that Keurig made for their coffee makers, and neither works well at all. Going to have to buy a regular coffee maker to use ground coffee. Will use this Keurig for when I'm in a hurry."
"Are you a coffee lover? Then this coffeemaker is for you!!! I've never had coffee with such flavor before! This is the best purchase I've ever made! Since there are many flavors available in the k-cups, you can try all of them, you can buy a sampler box to try different flavors. My daughter loves the hot chocolate, and my husband the hot tea. So it was a win-win for the entire family!!!"
Noisy but make great coffee. Like my original version better. This model is much more lightweight. Our first Keurig lasted seven years. I do not think this one is going to make it that long. I agree with most of the other review. Take a look at this model at a local store before buying online if you have any concerns.
"This has been a gift! When you struggle in the morning to find a coffee filter, fill the regular pot, wait for it to drip...and then you have a Keurig! Fumbling hands can handle the k cup.  We use 8 O'clock coffee Kcup and its yummy. I like my coffee stronger so I use the 'small cup"" setting twice, as a medium or tall cup will be too weak for me."
"Stopped working after three or four cups, heating water fine, simply wouldn't let me use it, lights would not blink to select cup size. Returning for replacement will see if after a week the next one does the same."
"This works well. We had an issue when we made the first cup as it didn't fill the cup, it only went halfway up but we picked the middle size. It must have had some air in it as it worked fine after that and has since. Tip: even if you do the clean cycle, run a few test cups before actually brewing your first real cup of coffee. That should work out any air in the lines."
"If you are used to drinking a mug of coffee, this will seem inadequate.  Even on the large cup setting, you will not feel satisfied with the volume dispensed, and the brew will be anemic.  You'll want a second cup , but if you're like me, the $ signs will be mentally adding up.  The machine operates as advertised, but at the cost of the machine plus the expense of the pods, the convenience of the system really doesn't seem worth it."
Every time I use this coffee maker (Keurig K55) I have problems.  I have read the directions carefully but have not been able to solve the problems. I have only used filtered water but from the beginning it has just made about 2 tablespoons of coffee and then stops.I would now like to return the product.
"I bought this Keurig new (not refurbished), and after 14 months of once-a-day use it has stopped working. Sounds like the pump has pooped out. It worked just long enough for the warranty to expire, of course. Ridiculous that the quality of such a premium priced machine is so poor. It should last at least a few years, or if it is impossible to build something that will last that long, the price point should be much lower. Being without my morning coffee makes me very cranky!"
"I am very pleased with the coffee quality.  I am using San Francisco Bay coffee pods.  The only reason I did not give it 5 stars was that the unit leaked water from the water reservoir where it connects to the unit.  It leaked water all over the counter.  This occurred on the very first day.  After some research on the internet, I found that several have had trouble with similar Keurig units that have removable water reservoirs.  I installed an additional o-ring and added silicone grease and it has not leaked since. However, you really should not have to do this on a brand new unit."
"Arrived on time and in good condition. So far is working perfectly with no issues at all. I've read some reviews complaining it doesnt make a strong enough cup but it seems fine to me. But I have to admit, I am NOT a serious coffee drinker. Anything stronger than medium roast tastes like mud to me so maybe I'm not the person to ask. Its quick, easy and the coffee is hot. Yes, it does make some whirring and gurgling sounds, but nothing that's going to wake up the house...And I'm using it at 4AM."
Gross. Disgusting. Can't believe I fell into the hype and wasted my money just to save 3 minutes. I even bought the top rated Kcups (tried Starbucks and Kirkland - that don't expire for 10 more months! LOL).I can't believe coffee MFG's even load their coffee in KCups. They apparently will do anything to make a dollar.I'm moving back to grinding/brewing fresh. This is just a horrible idea.
"Simple to use, but my only complaint is that sometimes it doesn't indicate water is needed until after a brew button has been pushed, so if I push the button and walk away I might come back to see the blue refill light on and no coffee in my cup. It should indicate water is needed before I push the button, and not flash the brew buttons unless there is enough water for the largest cup option."
It is a good brewer for the money.  It has 3 size cups to choose from. I was spoiled by my last Keurig which had 5 sizes to choose from.  It is easy to operate.  It's great to have a fresh cup of coffee ?? each time.
"We are not coffee drinkers but most of the world is, so I wanted an easier way for our guests to enjoy their am cup of cofffee. I hated having half drunk pots of coffee on my counters and disposing of those gross grinds, so I invested in this 'like new' Keurig and a 60 pack of assorted k cups and I am totally satisfied with my choice. My main concern was that the machine worked and the coffee was hot and I haven't been dissapointed yet. 5 stars from all of my house guests so far!"
"I should have checked the reviews on Keurig products. It worked wonderfully well for about a month, but after that it started brewing only a half cup at a time, necessitating that the process be repeated. Although this is not a terrible problem, it is inconvenient. I tried all the ""fixes"" recommending by others (clearing the spout with a paper clip, running water with and without white vinegar through it, running water through it without a K cup inside, etc. and nothing worked. Curiously, it WILL brew a complete cup if I leave the K cup out and run the water through; so at least I can warm a cup of water in one cycle!"
I purchased this to replace our Keurig at work.  Many of us use coffees with non-standard pods (environmentally friendly top with a tiny bag underneath or a refillable plastic pod)  A Keurig approved pod with bar code is NOT required so you can use any coffee pod. (the Keurig 2.0s require a Keurig brand approved pod so you can't all coffee pods)
Love this machine. For the first time I have a Keurig that stays on all the time. Previously I had ones with auto off features. I love being able to grab a cup quickly without waiting for the water to heat. It is everything I have come to expect of Keurig. Not sure why others have given it low ratings. In my opinion it is definitely a 5 star product.
Even though this was recommended on the amazon site--it brewed one cup and would never brew another--returned with credit and ordered the K575--like it.
"I've used and set up multiple Keurigs over the last 5 years with no problems. Before I could even use all of the samples in this model, it broke. I returned it and got another, and in under one month, it also broke.Gentle use should not break two $100+ coffee machines in such a short period of time. Stay away from this model Keurig."
"Outstanding product; nobody does single-serve coffee better.  Keurig regained their good sense after designing a version 2.0 machine that would ONLY brew Keurig-branded K-cups, despite having licensed the K-cup to many other coffee sellers. That ""feature"" now has been removed.  I'm thinking that some new MBA decided that Keurig owned the market and could do anything they wanted.  Not so.  This model is known to work with all brands of K-cups.  Buy this model."
our old one died after many years.  this one is nice and a lot quieter.  the one annoying thing is that it makes you add water even though it looks like there is enough in the chamber for at.least one more cup.
"I had a first generation Keurig, but eventually it became difficult to raise the lid because the handle seemed to stick, though it did still work.  I bought this one and so far I like it.  It is MUCH less noisy than my old Keurig.  I find that it works better without the filter, so I removed the filter apparatus.  It is perfect for my needs."
I use this every morning (and some afternoons). I am a die-hard coffee junkie and I cannot get enough of this machine. I was using a very old school coffee maker until I bought this and i'm glad I upgraded. It is fast and I love all the little k-cup options. I also bought the my k-cup thing and I really enjoy having the option to put in coffee grounds if I want. I like to mix some of the k-cup and have a little mixed coffee drink like i'm my own barista. It's easy to clean and easy to operate. I'm wondering why I didn't get one sooner!
I bought this back in July and still runs as good as the first day I bought it and I use it everyday.  Great product!
"I finally succumbed to the 1 cup at a time parade. My K55 works very well. It is fast to heat and dispense my flavor of the day. For all the coffee thrown out over the years, this makes sense. Why brew lots of 1 flavor when.you can enjoy.several flavors each day!?!"
"Bought this as a replacement for an older model. So far very happy with the purchase. It works great right out of the box with very little setup needed. It is quieter than our previous model and does not take long to heat up. I think the only downside to this model is that it does not have an auto-on feature, but again it doesn't take long to brew after you turn it on. Overall I am happy with this brewer."
"We have been dealing with a Mr. Coffee off brand Keurig. Finally sucked it up and purchased this one.So far we love it. The cup sizes are consistent (if not a little smaller than we'd like) and we love that there is a decent sized reservoir.My boyfriend brews with out a k-cup for hot water for his tea, and I use k-cups and a re-usable k-cup, all situations have worked perfectly!"
"So far, the Keurig K55 works well but only time will tell how well.  This is my fifth coffee maker - my two initial purchases were Keurig units but the Keurigs only lasted a few years and then two iCoffee makers but the units also broke down.  I'm back to Keurig and we'll see how long this unit lasts.  Actually, we use both a four cup Mr. Coffee maker with cone filter which we like because of the coffee flavor and the Keurig which we use if we only need a personal cup."
"My wife had gone to visit her parents out of state, while there she visited her sister who has one of these, she fell in love with it.  Asked me to get one, I didn't like the idea of buying individual cup deals.....then I came across the Keurig 5048 reusable filter......that sold the device.  After some early stumbles we have come to love this device. My biggest complaint is the cup sizes.....we have big coffee cups, 14 oz, this maker makes 6,8 or 10 oz cups.  What we have done is use a 2 cup measuring cup, brew a 10 and then a 6, using the same filter full of coffee...problem solved, just fill the cup and you are ready to go."
No more wasted coffee!!!!!!!!!!!! Brewing a single cup at a time takes just about 1 minute. This beats the heck out of making an 8 - 10 - or 12 cup pot and throwing some or most of it away. And there are soooo many types of K-Cups available. You can drink whatever flavor you wish and so can everyone else who is having a cup.
"Takes K cups. Three buttons for low, medium and high amounts of coffee. Base shown can be removed for taller containers. Heats the water in 15 seconds. Easy to keep clean. My previous coffee maker  -  same brand  - lasted five years."
"I have not been a Keurig fan, however I found some k cup coffees that actually have FLAVOR. This ones a keeper."
"Bought this to put in our RV.  Still have a 4 year old K75 that we love.  This unit has a much cheaper feel, which is not that much of an issue.  However, it seems to lose its pump prime when the water runs low and I pull the reservoir to fill.  Have to turn it on and off several times to get it to dispense properly.  Clearly there is somemalfunction going on there.  Given that, along with the significantly smaller reservoir which requires filling way more often then our K75, I would not buy this again."
"I bought this Keurig May 24th and a month later it's already not working right.  When filling the water reservoir to heat, it makes a horrible sound and it doesn't fill the reservoir, I have to remove the water tank several times before it will finally pull the water in to heat. I love the Keurig's but this one is a dud.  These cost too much to only last approximately 1 month."
"So far I love this K55.  Set up took awhile and during set up it was really noisy, but afterwards it was just fine.  It brews nicely and makes 3 cups of coffee, or tea or ?, in short order.  I read several of the customer reviews on the brewer and I am a little concerned about the reliability of the product, but I am keeping an  open mind."
"LOVE. I had bought one the week before from the big blue store, but returned it for this. The first one I bought was the same price, but you had to add water every time, and my kids were spilling it all over the place. This holds enough for six-ish cups at a time. And yes, it uses any brand of cups."
"I love the convenience of the Keurig machine.  I had mine for four and a half months, took very good care of it, used the filter pods and only used filtered water in it but all of a sudden the pump stopped working.  Fortunately Keurig has a one year warranty on it so I was able to get it replaced through them.  Hope this next one lasts longer."
"Comes with no information except how to descale the pot.  While this coffemaker can hold a travel mug and has coffee cup size buttons to select which size coffee cup you want up to a travel mug, when you push the travel mug size you only get a normal size cup of coffee.  What a shock!  To get a travel size mug we have to use to pods and run it through two times.  Rather stupid."
"My super automatic machine broke down and had to be shipped back for repairs (took six weeks). I bought this as an emergency backup. I was surprised at how much I liked it.  I think the coffee pods are key to the taste...I liked the Gevalia best. My automatic is back now but if I have to invest in another repair charge, I may just forget it and use the Keurig permanently."
"Please DO NOT BUY this Keurig! I will be returning my second one in a matter of months. It first works fine, though noisy, then it just stops making the coffee. I put in the water, it heats up, I press the button and nothing comes out! This is so very frustrating! I thought Keurig was a good brand, but I was wrong!"
"I am so disgusted with the Keurig coffeemaker that I purchased for my husband. He has probably made 30 cups of coffee with it.  It no longer will heat the water, much less make a cup of coffee.  Press the power button and it lights up. then it makes a grinding racket. Then, we unplug it andhe makes a pot of coffee in our $9.98 Mr Coffee coffee maker.  How disgusting!  I feel like it was a total rip off to buy an expensive Keurig."
Easy and fast to use
The one with automation failed after a few years. I down graded to this one and it works very well. Wish the water tank was larger
"Quick to unpack, even with all the tape tabs holding parts in place. Just a quick rinse & filter setup (2 water filters, 3 coffee pods & a hot chocolate pod included) and I got my first cup of coffee. The water reservoir and size settings were the only must-have features for me, and this product delivered at a reasonable price."
I do like the machine. It is easy to use and so far has not had any issues EXCEPT... it's messy. The liquid splashes all over the counter no matter what size cup I'm using:( I have had it for 3 months now and use it only when I want to pamper myself with yummy flavored coffee.
I wish I could give this NO STARS. I have had to replace this item twice. Even tried to fix the second unit. Both items ( since mother's day in may) have broken on me and motor has died. I am so sad because I love me my coffee. Sadly I will be returning my newest one and not be getting another. Spend the extra $20 and get the better unit.
It is the most tempermental appliance I have ever used. One morning it works perfect and the next one not till the 5th or 6th attempt. This morning my wife couldn't get it to work at all. We started over 4 or 5 times and finally it worked. Almost wants to make me give up my morning coffee.
Awesome! Heats up super fast and has a timer for automatically shutting off. Those were the two features I was most looking for. Easy to maintain and easy to use. High recommended vs other models.
love it!! quieter version of my last one. Very affordable!!
Piece of junk.  Very disappointed. I've had Keurig machines for years.  Had to replace a unit that went bad.  I have now had 2 of these K55 units. Both quit within days of use.
Product arrived quickly and so far has been great.  Produces a great cup of coffee relatively quickly and the assortment of k-cups available seems endless.  Very happy.
"This quickly became a big hit in my house. We use a pyres percolator for our morning java, but in the afternoon, sometimes I just want a cup of coffee without the hassle. This works perfectly. It makes a great cup of coffee. I'm a serious coffee snob, so that's saying something'"
"My wife pulled me onto the Keurig train. I prefer to make coffee the old fashioned way with a drip, but I will admit I have fallen in love with the convenience of the Keurig. My only real gripe with this machine is it nags for more water when there's still a few inches left in the reservoir and won't make any more coffee until it's topped off."
"Worth every penny.  This was all for my coffee drinking wife until I discovered junior mint hot cocoa, now me and the kids are in the game."
"We have talked about getting a Keurig coffee maker for several years now.  When I saw this one on a special deal on Black Friday I went ahead and purchased it with my credit card points.  I was so excited when it arrived that I quickly opened it and set it up on the counter.  I am happy to say I brewed the first cup of hot chocolate from the sample pack that came with the machine.  I sure am glad it came with a few K-cups since I forgot to order some when I ordered the machine!  The machine is super easy to set up and brews super quick as well.  I absolutely love this machine.  I no longer have to brew an entire pot of coffee that is all the same.  I can quickly and easily brew a cup at a time and give everyone exactly what they want.This particular machine has three cup sizes from which to choose which is wonderful.  My husband loves a super strong coffee so he uses Sumatra coffee with the small cup setting.  His coffee is nice and bold every time.  I prefer flavored coffees and I usually use the medium cup setting.My machine also has a two hour auto shut off feature that you can set up which is wonderful.  We will never have to wonder if we left it on or not.  When you turn the Keurig K55 on it only takes a few seconds before it is ready to brew your favorite brew!  I also love that this model has a water reservoir so you don't have to add water each time you wish to brew a cup of coffee.There were four different colors from which to choose.  I chose black because it was the cheapest.  There was white, blue and red as well; however, the other colors were a lot more expensive then the black.I am so happy I purchased my new Keurig K55 coffee maker.  Now, when it comes to coffee and other hot beverages, everyone is happy all the time!"
"Had to return because it made cups of tea that tasted and smelled like plastic. I felt like what I was drinking would surely cause me cancer? I love how convenient it is, but not worth it."
"If you take good care of it, clean it regularly and follow the instructions on how to use it, you should have absolutely no problems.  Makes a great cup of joe in less than a minute."
"I really like this coffee maker. It is incredibly easy to use and I don't use the filter in the water tank because I am using Brita water which is already filtered. However, when the three lights blink to pick a size, it doesn't work unless I open the part where the k cup goes and then close it again. A minor issue. I love this coffee maker and it makes fantastic coffee."
Great coffee maker I bought this to replace an order model I took to work to use there. I love Keuig it's so simple and easy when you don't drink a lot of coffee and only want one cup.
Had my old Keurig coffee maker for about 5 years and had to upgrade and so far this has been a great product with no issues at all
"I bought this model for work because I wanted the same one that I have at home. Even though I've used the one I have at home for years with no problems, however, this particular refurbished Keurig has not worked properly. The line keeps getting clogged and it won't pull water from the reservoir into the unit itself, and coffee will not come out. Unfortunately, I'm now beyond the thirty day return window, and I foolishly did not buy the protection plan. Hopefully it'll start working better so that I can continue to use it at work."
"This unit is much bulkier than I was expecting. I had used a smaller Keurig at a friend's house (apparently an older model) that I liked better. Sometimes the water can be slow to heat up, and the coffee is generally weaker than I would like. I make sure to select the smallest cup button, as the medium and large settings produce too watery a brew. I've tried multiple roasts and brands of K-Cup, so I think it's this unit that's a bit subpar. But it works well enough and is not worth the hassle of returning."
"Although we love our KEURIG coffee, this unit that we bought in May failed today. The heat sensor failed and so we have to buy a new unit. I will rate this a 4 star because I do love the coffee, but if it fails on the next unit, I will be rating it a one star."
"Had this keurig originally and when the came out with the new one that came with a carafe I had to have it. That was a big mistake, the keurig didn't work the same way and was more of a pain in the ass. Ended up buying the older version all over again. Why fix it if it ain't broke right? Love this model!"
"Liked most things about this item, but very disappointed that it does NOT actually generate a ""large"" setting 12oz cup, only 10oz.and there seems to be no way to adjust that limit.  If 10oz is the most you'll ever want, the I do highly recommend this item."
"It's working and the coffee is hot.  However it worries me every time I make a cup of coffee.  You can hear the motor inside running pretty loud as it sucks the water into it.  It makes me laugh, never heard anything quite like it.  But, as long as it keeps pumping out hot coffee, no complaints from me."
"Two of these failed to work right out of the box.  What a hassle returning a large piece of useless plastic, full of water that cannot be drained!  And, now stuck with dozens of K-cups, purchased in anticipation of enjoying the touted superior Keurig experience, my slightly bruised ego commanded me to continue my quest of the holy coffee grail.  So off to my local bulk warehouse store for the up-scale model (more $).  It has worked now for two whole days!  I win!?"
"Purchased this item to replace a similar one received as a gift several years ago which stopped working. This item arrived a few weeks ago and the box had been retaped although not damaged. I wondered if the product was a reconditioned machine although advertised as ""new"". I have had one issue already during use similar to my previous machine's problem. I wonder?"
"This model is an upgrade from my previous Keurig. I don't need the fancy programmable screens.  This model is simple, sturdy, attractive and does the job of brewing a hot beverage beautifully. You aren't limited to one brand of k-cups. Every brand I've tried works perfectly."
Makes wonderful coffee.  Doesn't make as much noise as some reviewers say.  The nicest part is you don't have to add water whenever you want to make a cup of coffee and it has three brewing levels.  I usually use the biggest because I like having a larger cup of coffee than my old Keurig made.  Great purchase.
"My husband bought this Keurig for me for Christmas and it worked great at first. Now, only 7 months later I can't get the thing to produce a cup of coffee. We have cleaned it out, made sure filter was clean of debris... it just wont work. I wanted to return it, but that is not an option anymore. This was our first experience with the new way to make coffee and I'm disappointed and want my Mr. Coffee coffee maker back."
Parent were ecstatic and could hardly wait to use it. Needless to say I let them open this present on Christmas Eve because the family was present and we all wanted coffee. My mothers' old coffee machine weeks ago and they were using instant until they could get a new coffee pot. I got them two I one.
"If i could give this machine a zero rating I would.  It began pumping hot water into the cold water reservoir after about producing only 20 or so e cups of coffee,  very disappointed.  Other members of the family had similar issues. the Cuisinart works better."
Love this coffee maker...have used an expensive espresso maker for years and still love it but purchased this one for speed and was pleasantly  surprised at how good the coffee is and it is quick!
"It was built much cheaper that the one before that.  Had I known it was built with all plastic parts, I would have opted for a better machine."
"Really didn't think I'd like this thing... but needed a system for a single person that does not drink a bunch of coffee.  Turns out I like it... for me it is perfect.  Bought the reuse/use your own pods to use along with the standard K cup pods, between the two I can pretty much get what ever I want!"
"As always, Keurig products are the best.  I purchased this one to replace my 5 year old Keurig that was beginning to act up.  Have used this one for a couple of months now.  Very pleased.  Quick and quiet."
"Good machine. Works very well. Drips quickly, an the quietly. The best part has a large water holder. Can make several cups of coffee without needed to fill it up. Use regular tap water."
"Sadly, the quality of this machine was less than expected. Our original had metal parts, this has plastic. Our original had feature this new equivalent machine does not. Made cheaper. Feel like I spent too much money on it. Quite a disappointment."
"I get that it's bad for the environment; is pricey; makes inferior, watered-down coffee; and so on and so forth—all of it true—but as a working parent, being able to have just one cup of hot, fresh coffee on demand has been worth every last penny. A little worried about machine longevity given the reviews, but so far so good."
"Purchased this for my mother for Christmas, opened it up and it was in perfect condition. Follow the directions on how to set it up and prep the water filter and made my first cup of coffee with it. Needless to say, but it was wonderful! We are using it like crazy now. Makes HOT coffee in just moments!"
I bought this as a gift for my mom and she doesn't like it. However she threw the box away so I couldn't return it. She never really stated why but she wasn't impressed. After she saw my Starbucks Verismo machine she stated she would have rather had that but she doesn't like Starbucks coffee.
Love it! Works like a charm and delivers a fresh cup of coffee to a poor sap who's been drinking instant for the past 5 years.
Absolutely love the Keurig. I've had no issues with it at all. Makes coffee quickly (about a minute total) and it's heated to a perfect temperature. Absolute necessity for a college student.
"Yum! Finally I bought one and I chose this one because even though it's an older model,  it still got the best reviews. So far so good! I've used it for kcup coffee, hot cocoa, and even used it for heating up water for my tea. Very nice simple sleek design. Hope thus puppy lasts me a long time."
"Just as good as my original Keurig.  This allows me to use my grocery store bought refillable pods.  I can also put a teabag in instead of a pod and run the hot water right through it or get just hot water.  The water tank and removable cup base are interchangeable with my old ones as well.  Only tiny comment is that instead of a LED light in the tank to tell you when your water level is low, there is a tiny indicator light on the top with the other buttons.  I love it.  It is just what I wanted."
Fresh cup of coffee in a minute or so.  Much better than brewing a whole pot and trying to drink it before it gets old or turning it off and microwaving a cup.
"Broke after seven months. Some kind of motor problem. And when I first bought it, it took a week of cycling water through this machine before coffee stopped tasting like overheated plastic.Corporate greed has ruined yet another nice thing in life."
"I love my Keurig! It is wonderful! I have even found K cups that can be recycled.  The only reason I did not give it five stars is because a week after I bought this one, they went on sale even more! I could've saved as much is $20 off of the price of my Keurig and could not because I had already purchased one."
"Ultimate sin to have a single cup of coffee. Could be argued that this can save money as you don't throw ""old"" coffee away. Be sure to use the auto off feature as we left the old Keurig on all the time. 24 hours of constant heating may have lead to it's demise after 3 years of faithful service."
I have used this thing everyday since I got it and have had no problems whatsoever. :)
Does this thing have a warranty? I bought it in November as a Christmas present. By the second week of January it no longer works. Can't give a good review on $ wasted.
"Have had a Keurig for many years and it finally collapsed. Bought this modeland it was very, very slow. Exchanged it and the next one, in addition to beingslow, had a mind of its own...sometimes a full cup, but more often 1/2 or 3/4.Now going to try the K200, hopefully with more success."
"Love this thing. Simplified my morning routine. Ordered last April, still works like a charm. Probably buying one for each parent for Christmas since good coffee is an important thing in my family. Buy the Starbucks k cups, they taste great."
"Great coffee machine, I use it on a daily basis in an office setting with several uses throughout the day, and it's been holding up pretty nicely. It's not that loud, and doesn't take forever to heat up."
"Pretty great product, the only negative is that it takes substantially longer than some other Keurigs to brew a cup of coffee. It might take between 30 seconds to a minute to make a cup. Not a big deal if you're on the move and grabbing your car keys while making your coffee, just something to be aware of."
"First off, let me say, I don't drink coffee.  Never have and never will.  But I've seen different Keurigs in action at work.  My wife wanted one of these for home, so I bought this model after some research.  The 2.0 models seemed high maintenance and shady due to having a sensor that scans the cups.  The K55 is a nice looking machine that fits well in our stainless steel kitchen, and can make coffee with ANY k-cup.  My wife loves this model, except for the fact that it seems to use more water than other models, so more refilling than desired.  I actually enjoy using this to get hot water for my tea, although it's not at boiling temperatures as I would like.  I gave this 4 stars due to the water refilling issue, but it's really a minor gripe that's all my wife's because I don't care."
"Best coffee machine for a lazy guy like me! Works well, makes coffee quickly, no problems at all. Totally in love with this machine!It takes about 30 seconds after you click to heat the water, and another 30 seconds to fill up the largest cup (it has 3 cup sizes). No hassle at all."
Definitely enjoying my first Keurig. The water heats up fast when in auto-off mode so it does save energy. Haven't had any problems with kcups not fitting. Love the 3 cup size settings as I can only drink 1/2 a cup of coffee in the morning. I use it for tea most of the time. Glad I purchased it!
"Bought this as a gift for my son's family. Everyone is in love with it.  The kids can make their own hot chocolate, and the parents can have their favorite drink."
"I bought this unit to replace and older Keurig that no longer worked. The older one had a clock with an auto on/off feature. Non of the newer versions have this feature, so I thought I would be disappointed with my new one. But I just keep it on and it is always ready to use. No problem."
"I really like the convenience of the Keurig, when you just want one cup it is very handy. The coffee comes out hot and tastes good. I like that is came withe the water filters too."
"After my last Keurig bit the dust (my fault, not Keurig's), I decided to upgrade from the cheapest-model-possible to this one.  It was 100% worth it.  This one even filters my crappy hard water, so I don't have to resort to using bottled water."
"I bought this maker for my wife(I don't drink coffee).  She was hesitant at first because it is so different from her other coffee makers through the years.  Now she absolutely loves it.  We have tried several different brands of coffee for it and they all work without problem.  She couldn't be happier, so I am happy with this Keurig."
"I have a older version of this and I wanted to upgrade , no reason just been around 3-4 years so why not.  Get it the handle is cheap plastic feel,  drip tray is plactic,  and the water doesn't have a glow light.  Mean while my older model has all ""metal"" and a water glow light not a fan"
"I was so excited to finally buy and use a keurig! Imagine my disappointment after using it for a month and have it stop working... it just stopped. The light came on, I pushed the button and no water. Not only that it never turned off. I tried again later in the day, same problem. I unplugged the machine and tried again, nothing.I waited for a few years before buying one. I even stopped my morning run to Starbucks because I was making coffee at home and bringing it with me in the car. Imagine my diappointment this morning when I could not make coffee!I guess for now its back to Starbucks...I am very disappointed."
"Faulty from day 1 and didn't last 3 days!  This was my second Keurig.  The first one lasted only a year or so.  I was nervous about getting a second one, since the first one was pretty short lived.  Now I'm sorry I spent my gift card money on it."
"Replaced my original Keurig single serve that's about 6 years old. I must say I am disappointed. First of all it ships with very short electrical cord so unless you can place it extremely close to an outlet you have to use an extension cord. Secondly cheaply made, lightweight plastic parts. Thirdly although you can program three different serving sizes the 2 larges sizes put out servings that are dilute-i.e. more water with the same K-cup.I didn't buy the newest Keurig due to the relatively large numbers of negative reviews. This one works but it's been cheapened down to save pennies and I can't see the benefit of three serving sizes if your coffee,etc is diluted out. I'm going to have to look elsewhere. Keurig has gone down hill"
"This appliance is so awesome! I don't know how we ever lives without it! It's easy to use and we do ever say! We use it to put water in oatmeal, make Tea and coffee of course. It even pairs well with some random refill cups I got for regular ground coffee!  We've had it for 3 months now and it had no had any issues at all!"
Highly recommend for newly wed or new homes. The only difference with more expensive versions is that they can do k lattes and other sorts which you can brew multiple cups. And i usually find touch screens can usually malfunction. So i decided to go basic and love it!!! Bought the shelving for the k cups and it looks great in my kitchen. Maintenance is super easy which is changing the water filter every 2-3 months. Instructions were pretty easy to follow.
"Keurig has never done me wrong.  This is my 5th one I've owned.  This thing is in my office and is constantly getting used throughout the day.  Works without issue and built to last.  Keep it up Keurig, don't go cheap on your products!"
"It worked great for a month, and now it doesn't work anymore but it's 6 days too late to return/replace it. I have to use the same pod three times in a row now to fill my coffee mug. It's was probably worth it to buy a more expensive model at the time. Lesson learned."
"Use it several times a day, unit is almost a year old. What more can you say? It's another stable dependable unit from Keurig!"
"works great, you cannot control the temp and how long the coffee brews. So if you like your coffee strong you might want to consider a french press, but we still enjoy it greatly. The kids love to make hot chocolate with it and tea. Works much better than a hot tea pot!"
Have purchased Keurig's in the past and loved the product but got a lemon on this purchase.  Never had to return anything before but apparently not able to return this one because it's 8 days after the one month return policy.  Very disappointed and hope to have a resolution even it's getting a replacement coffee maker.
My last Keurig lasted 5 years.  This one hasn't brewed 5 cups and it stopped.  I did what the book said as a troubleshooting remedy.... nothing.  It is 5:00 am.  And I'm working on a Keurig for one stinking cup of coffee.  My first call will be too Keurig when they open.  I am not happy.??
"We had the power source,go bad on our last Keurig that we had for at least 3 years. This product we thought would be better since it is a newer model. I hate our new Keurig. It's cheaply made, the hinge that opens for the KCups is weak. The old brewer kept the water hot so when you loaded the KCup it was ready. The new model fills up after you press the dispense button. There is no signal that the water is out until after, so twice now I have walked away and came back to an empty coffee cup because I needed to add water."
"The only thing I like better than coffee is faster coffee!  I am glad to have purchased Keurig Single K-cup pod coffeemaker.  I can now enjoy a rich cup of coffee anytime I want without having to make a whole pot.  My husband loves it too,"
"I was very excited to get my first Keurig 6 months ago. I only used it two or three times a week, and after a few months it started making some straining noises when making the coffee and this morning it just quit working all together.Very disappointing. I'm too busy/lazy to deal with trying to return or repair it, so I'm just eating the loss. Could just be random bad luck in my case, but it seems like others have had similar issues. For the price, I would expect much more reliability. I won't be purchasing a Keurig again."
"Had a K-70 Platinum model previously.  It crapped out after only 4 years.  While this model is more cheaply made, it brews just as good a cup of coffee as the expensive model and if it craps out after 4 years, I'll have spent much less.  (Don't pay too much for your whistle -- as long as it toots!)"
"The Keurig works well.  The cups size selection is a little awkward.  I typically have to select a large and then a small for a mug or a medium and a a small.  Other than that, it works well.  Does not drip after cup is complete like our flexbrew did."
"OMG why didn't we get one of these long ago!  No more wasted pots of coffee.  And I can make tea on the spot.  Got the refillable Brewslang K cups, very cool.  I can adjust the strength of coffee for each person's taste, or make tea with loose tea.  Bought a second one for my 91 yr old dad's house, he loves it too.  So easy to set up, even for this non-DIY blonde!  (And since I AM blonde, I can make blonde jokes, so there!)  Mummy will be getting one for Mum's day, fer sure!"
I love this my Keurig!! I wish they were cheaper BUT they are worth the money! I am single so it cuts back on me being wasteful by using a coffee maker. It doesn't take long for it to heat up the water for you to then be able to select the cup size you desire and then enjoying your cappuccino!
Definitely love this and love being able to use any K-Cup from any brand. Highly recommend over knockoffs.
"This is the second Keurig I've purchased and I'm very satisfied. My first one wasn't brewing well because I failed to maintain it over the years. Very happy with this one and definitely will probably descale it regularly this time around.It's quick, easy to use, and brews a perfect cup every time."
My first Keurig and I really like it.  Easy to use and does not require daily cleaning like a regular brewer.  It is compact and fits nicely on my cabinet.  Coffee is fresh every cup is what I really like.
We bought this to replace our previous Keurig. Don't like this one as much: smaller well and noisier. But it does the job. Wouldn't recommend if you make lots of drinks in a short time because of the well capacity.
"Got this as a replacement to our breakroom Keurig. It doesn't have any many options as our much older model (Strange), but it brews our much needed fuel to keep us going. It's sleek looking and very easy to set up and get working."
"Seems a bit slower than the old (3 years) Keuirg that died.But still better than waiting for a pot to brew.Update: I just missed the 30 day return window. It is getting even slower and louder. There is something wrong with this unit. Not very happy about this..Update: After much BS, Keurig is replacing it.I will gladly burn this one.."
"needs more than three settings and the need for filtered water is a pain. Makes good coffee though.  Also the k-cup is partially defective as it does NOT punch through at the bottom to brew. Used one from old one. Works fine. Hey Keurig, wake up and do some QC"
I have purchased two of these units in a month and both have stopped working after approximately 12 cups of coffee. I have a friend who received one as a gift and has also stopped working. I truly believe that Keurig needs to recall these units.
"I love Keurig and this was a replacement of previous one I used until it died.  Only negative, if one, is that this version does not have a brew button for hot water only.  No biggy.  I just purchased a separate hot water pot to use for tea and other hot water items."
"Purchased for my daughter for Christmas, and we love it.  There are SO many models of the Keurig, so make sure you know what you're getting.  Even though some are lower priced, you definitely want the one (like this) that has the water reservoir.  The NIFTY 6406 Under the Brewer Storage Drawer for K-Cup Pods, fits perfectly for this model."
"Thought I got the model like my work, but was disappointed when I found it didn't have the digital screen. And my girlfriend still would rather buy coffee from a store rather than make her own; because there is not cold brew solution."
"My only complaint is the reservoir.  Wish it held another 16 oz of water.  Other than that, it works great!  Makes 3 sizes of coffee - 6, 8 and 10 oz.  Turn it on, let it heat up and you can make 4 large cups of coffee before having to refill the reservoir."
I love love love this Keurig! I had debated for months and months to get one as I do not drink coffee. There are so many other options that I did not know of. Now I can get my hot TEA or hot APPLE CIDER or hot COCOA in just a couple mins !  It delivers a perfect cup every time. Now I wish I had gotten it sooner.
"what can I say, we bought one and now use this amazing little machine EVERY day - it works fantastic!we also bought one as a Christmas present for my Nephew and his wife...they called a few days later thanking us and telling us what an AWESOME gift this was! (one tip: buy a set of the mesh screen K-cup pods so you can put your own coffee and tea in them, they work great and save money)"
This is the second one I bought.  The first finally fell ill after 6 years of constant use.  Tried the larger Keurig and found it to be to difficult to work with.  This is a very simple and great coffee pot.  No fuss or mess.  I really recommend it.
"Purchased this Keurig for my dad for fathers day. He is a couple of cup coffee drinker and he had been wanting one for a while. Every time he is at our house he always comments on ours so it was time to get him one. This is the newer version of the one I have (K45) so I think a few things are different, especially from the appearance aspect but for the most part this is still the same thing.Here's a more detailed rundown of the features of this coffee maker.Appearance. This is exactly as pictured on the product page. There is a resevoir for water. I would recommend using filtered water or else you will get mineral buildup and will need to do a cleanup every once in a while. There are options for the 6, 8, 10 fl oz. I tend to use the 8 fl oz so I get a nice cup of coffee that is medium strength. I like that this is customizable.Function. I can speak to the 45 I have and we have had it about three years. I've never had issues with malfunctioning and I use it daily, multiple times a day. I can honestly say that I have gotten my money's worth on this product and I love it. I couldn't live without it.Price point. At 97.99, this is fair and competitively priced. It may seem like a big purchase upfront but once you go keurig it's hard to go back. I love that you get a perfect cup of coffee every time.Overall I love my machine and so does my dad."
"2016 08 21: I bought this in June 2016. Worked fine. Last week, grounds started appearing in every cup of coffee and in the space around the K-cup. I looked in the book that came with it for troubleshooting and there was no troubleshooting entry for grounds in the coffee cup. So, I went to the web site and there were troubleshooting directions, which we followed. This process did not work and there are still grounds in the coffee cup and machine. I hate it."
"Keurig's photos are deceiving - they show full mugs, but 9.25 oz (which they claim is 10 oz) in my mug is about 2/3 full. Disappointed with my purchase."
"I was able to get a good deal on this, and purchased it for the office.  It cost less than a couple of 'bagel-days', and is a great hit!  We generally purchase biodegradable coffee pods, and have had no complaints - even the tea and soup set loves its versatility!"
Works even better then expected.  You only use what you need when you need it.  Perfect!!!
Seems like a great idea. But every cup tastes extremely watered down and comes out cold. I will be going back to my old Mr. Coffee coffee maker.
"So easy to use, no problems so far. Perfect temperature for me. Makes a great cup of coffee. I would say the most it can make with the water reservoir is about 3 cups? Which is great for my husband and me."
Very cheap made.  The lid where the coffee pod goes doesn't stay up while putting pod in. water is hard to fill because of the angle it's at.  It only has 3 sizes of coffee.  I would not ever buy another one or even recommend it to anyone.
"Gave this as a gift to my sister. You would've thought I'd given her a million dollars! She loves it, just about everyday she tells us how much she loves. I think this Keurig is a very good machine."
Great Keurig. I bought to replace an older model. Works well and has good quality.
This item worked for only 3 days then I couldn't get so much as a spritz of water out of it.  Kuerig has completely lost my business with any of their products.its not even worth 1 star. The only reason my review even gave it 1 star is because my review wouldn't post if I didn't put one in.
"Great product, this coffee maker has been around for awhile now and I have never heard anything negative about it. I really like this appliance."
"Very unfortunate, the Keurig has stopped working after only a few months.  We have read all the directions to see if it can possibly be something we could repair - or change - but so far nothing has worked.  We did enjoy it for those 2 months!"
"Does not consistently fill a cup the same level.  Slower then the single cup version for the first cup.  Does have the convenience with the water container, but a little finicky to put back in when full of water."
"Makes coffee, uses kcups - works great, better than i thought it would...happy.Thought dealing with kcups would be a difficult transition....not so much.Xtra FYI dealing with packing your own cups is a waste i dont have time...just buy the kcups. Ya i know environmental ....consciousness..blah yes...i recycle...im not a bad person.....dont judge me....."
"I have another Kurig which has a larger resouivor,  this holds less water than my other one so I am constantly adding water, but its a good product. When ordering check to see ounces of water it holds and how many ounces of coffee it brews, very important."
"when ever I have to add water to this machine it doesn't work.  I hit the medium size and if it even runs, I would get less than 1/2 cup of liquid.  It seems to be okay as long as I shut if off but will still mess up giving me small amounts no matter what size I choose.  I hate it.  I had the exact model like this for probably 3 to 4 years and loved it and had no troubles.  Junk!"
"Love this unit. Used to have it, and bought it as a gift. There are better deals out there...don't purchase here."
"...a reasonable cup or two of coffee quickly and without much fuss. Easier than actually brewing a cup in a perk pot or even using Mr. Coffee this model 55 (actually it appears from the base stamped info it's a model 40) does what you paid for. This is my second Type 55 (aka type 40), the first lasted four years...a little beyond the typical reported life span. But I only make two 12 oz cups a day, ten months a year so perhaps that accounts for my ""extra year"" of life.As others have reported I've noticed in this replacement version an ongoing ""plastic"" taste but I expect that might disappear in time with regular use. I don't recall this taste in my original but perhaps that's just my failure to recall the early days with my original brewer. In any event you get a much better brew at the Starbucks store by paying an additional buck-fifty per cup. And the old fashioned glass pot with Maxwell House in the brewing basket far outclasses the K-cup for real coffee flavor.Quick and Easy will never compete with old fashioned time and effort."
"The box was factory sealed! brand new!, the unit has been working perfectly for about 3 months now. we love using each and every day for Tea or Coffee. The price is excellent too, compared to other stores, you get a great product and also sealed meaning you know it comes directly from the source."
keurig has been great since the beginning of the 21st century but apparently their way to off the hook with the quality a hundred $ investment should last a year as the waranty says not 3-4 months...
"This is a nice, clean looking Keurig that I purchased as a replacement for my old first edition machine that died on me. I only wish I could change one thing about this coffee maker. It doesn't have a light in the water reservoir. Because it's black and my countertop and backsplash are also black, I have a hard time seeing the water level. Otherwise, it was a great purchase."
No coffee I have ever had at home is quite as good as the coffee I make with this Keurig. I originally bought it because I needed a low-acid coffee. Got said coffee and coffee maker. I don't think I can ever go back to anything else.
First keurig I've had. I love it. The directions state that it takes 4 min to heat the water. It doesn't take that long. It's pretty quick. I like the fact of having a reservoir so you don't have to fill each time for a cup.
Love this as an upgrade to my old single cup Keurig.  Heats water fast.  And can fit a travel mug under the spout when the cup stand is removed.
"This is the handiest electronic unit in my kitchen, really enjoy it."
I was a little late to the K-Cup coffee revolution.  This was a Christmas present from my wife and I really love this thing.  It’s simple to use and makes great coffee one cup at a time.  My wife and daughter also love the fact that it makes hot chocolate too!
"Perfect product for me! I am not a huge coffee drinker, but when I do want some coffee or tea it is quick and easy. I love that I can use it for hot water also. I definitely recommend, it is great for a single or 2 person household."
"Convenience. That's why we use this. It's our 3rd Keurig. It won't last forever just like the others, but that's ok. Make sure to clean regularly and use filtered water to prolong the life of this product, otherwise it might stop before you are ready for it to!"
"I am very pleased with this Keurig K55!  It is so nice to have a fresh cup of my favorite beverages!  I like being able to use it for just a hot cup of water for making soup, tea, spiced cider or whatever I would like!  For me and our house it rates a 10 ) !"
"This is my third Kerrigan, the first one started leaking, the second was a 2.0 and I couldn't use the pods I likes with it, this one doesn't work right. It doesn't move the water from the holder to the machine. I am done with this brand."
"I've had this product for under two months now and this morning it stopped working! It would not filter the water. I cleaned out the water basin, and the needles, still...no coffee. Will return."
"I was a long time hold out on the Keurigs. Once the price on the off brand k-cups came down I finally got one. I do really like it. I mostly use it without a k-cup because I just use the water for my tea bags but I do make coffee for my husband once a week and I love that I don't have to mess with the coffee grounds. It makes a really funny noise, though! Makes me laugh. ????"
"I love this Keurig, but I have only had it for 5 months and am all ready having issues with it.  Even with a water filter it is not pushing the water out completely and is very slow!! Why????"
"This is an obvious return as it was not taped up in a factory original fashion and arrived in a damaged carton. The price is right, but there is nothing indicating you may receive a returned product. I've never had this happen before with Amazon. Either I've been lucky or their practices have changed. Appears to be okay inside."
I love my Keuring.  I researched awhile before buying.  The only problem is that it does not make the coffee hot enough.  I still have to put in microwave.  Other than that it is perfect.  I received it before the promised date.  I have never been disappointed using Amazon.  Whenever I want to purchase something I automatically go the Amazon first.
"When it works, it's great! My original purchase lasted 4 months, before it started flashing the ""add water"", ""heating"" and middle brew size buttons (and was dead).  I called Keurig and their very friendly customer service sent me a free replacement.  That one lasted 4 weeks before the lights started flashing again.  So I called again and Keurig again sent me a free replacement.  That one lasted 3 days -- and just 3 cups of coffee.  I'm now looking for a more reliable brand."
"Regular coffee pots were a constant thorn in my side with constant water & coffee grounds ""mess"".  This coffee maker sure works GREAT & has once again brought harmony in the kitchen.  Its different cup sizes is wonderful for tea & hot chocolat too."
Great product. We use both freshly ground and cups. We had an extended family from parts of Scandinavia visit and you would think that they never had good coffee before! Probably used over 100 (I know because I bought the cups!) times in a week with no issues.
"Outstanding coffee maker. The last one I had lasted at least five years. Just don't drop it on the floor, it doesn't work well after that."
"Ar rived Opened today, used STYDDI 6 Pack Reusable K Cup,Refillable K-cup.. 6 Pack I had also ordered:  Packaging Great First Cup of Coffee was very nice. Love this unit shopped all the Brick Stores and many sites, Amazon was the winner.  ."
What a really nice quality kitchen appliance.  I love my coffee in the morning and different teas during the day.  One of the best things I've found about my new machine is that there is no MESS to deal with.  I highly recommend it to everyone!
"Keurig K55 Single Serve Programmable K-Cup Pod Coffee Maker, BlackWorks great, this one allows you to brew other manufacturers' K-cups, unlike the 2.0 versions. The price was right. (69.99) as of this writing,"
everything I thought I was getting with a few minor added perks like the large setting being perfect for the large mugs I have. I had originally thought they would be too big and have to run them twice or something. It ended up that the large setting filled them perfectly
Returned. Sounded like it was crushing rocks.  Old one never made a sound.  Worried about fire hazard
The needle in the K-cup holder bent at a 90 degree angle within a month of having it. As of this writing we do not have another K-cup holder
No issues. Upgraded from an older Keurig. The K55 has a replaceable two stage filter in the reservoir that must be replaced periodically. The Auto-Off feature is nice. Seems to heat and brew faster than older Keurig units.
"This machine lasted just over a year. Most of the time, it did a fine job; sometimes it would only give 4 or 5 ounces when you asked for 10. I've had previous Keurig machines fail (I always figured it was caused by unfiltered water). But, this time, I took special care to always use filtered water.I'm not sure if Keurig designs their products to fail after a year, or the machines are poorly designed/built. Either way, I think I'm done buying Keurigs for a while."
"They're making these coffeemakers cheaper and less sturdy than years ago.  This is okay but I'm anticipating it will die within a year and will have to be replaced again.  When the water heats up and I brew a cup of coffee, it's noisy and seems very laborious!"
This machine was a huge disappointment!  The bottom piercing element bent such that it did not make a hole in the bottom of the K-Cup.  The material must be of poor quality.  The machine cannot deliver the liquid into the coffee cup because the piercing element upon which the K-cup rests is bent over.  This is $100.00 down the drain!  I want to return it but I have had it for less than two months and the Amazon return policy ended 22 days ago.
"LOVE this coffee/hot beverage maker!  Performs great!  The only thing to watch out for is that you MUST use ONLY Keurig genuine coffee/tea.  It will NOT accept off label, unsanctioned brands of k-cups."
"Very happy with my purchase! Works great and brew a very hot cup of coffee. I ordered the suggested Variety sampler pack but that I didn't like, as I prefer to use my own loose coffee of my choice (Gevalia). For this...I highly recommend the Solofill Refillable filter (https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00LEO3XNM/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_5) which is a perfect match for this machine. You can decide the strength of your cup by the amount of coffee grains you fill it with. And you are also helping to save the planet with so many discarded KCups you won't produce. The machine is fast to be ready and fast to brew. Buy it!"
"Terrible!! Every cup brewed tasted like chemicals!! Left horrible taste in mouth and nearly undrinkable. Keurig may be using cheap Chinese plastics or something that interferes with the heating element, whatever it is.. They need to fix this asap. Unbelievable that they would allow a product like this to be made. Unit worked perfectly.. Just tasted awful. looked online and saw thousands of other people with the same problem. Returned and will wait for a properly none chemical filled version to hit the market."
"Love the Keurig coffee maker but I think we just got a bad one.  This was our second that we bought Nov 9 last year and it quit working today (May 27). We neglected to send in the warranty card or we could have likely gotten a replacement.  We did maintain it properly but it made more noise than the other one (that lasted much,  much longer) from the beginning."
"My family and I have agreed that this is the best purchase we can remember making! My husband is hooked on the cappucino, I love the apple cider and my kids love all the chocolate drinks and chai latte.It took us less than a minute to set it up and get our drinks. It's quick, quiet and efficient. Why did we ever wait so long? The good thing is we now have one! Yippee, we really recommend this Keurig!"
For some reason there is no way to predict how much coffee this model will make no matter what setting is selected. This is my second Keurig and it is a real disappointment. Other than that it is easier to use than the original.
We love our Keurig machine.  The coffee is good (although costs vary from approximately $.55/cup to nearly a dollar so buying cups requires doing the math to find the best bargains and still maintain the quality of brew you expect.
I have had the same model for years but the newer one is made cheaper. Plastic where there was metal.  Smaller water reserve. But it does have a replaceable filter which is good. Price and shipping were great.
"Received my new Keurig yesterday. Opened it, followed the set up instructions, test cup poured fine. Bright & early this morning with everything ready to go, it begins the brewing process and NOTHING! Weird. I checked everything, went back through the manual, put in a new cup, tried again. A teaspoon of coffee came out. At this point I'm getting out my old coffee maker and very frustrated. I called the Keurig customer service line, and mind you I've been messing with this thing with no coffee while getting the kids to school. Customer service lady was super rude. I had to get a paper clip and measuring cup. Stick the paper lip into 3 tiny holes in the upper needle to clear it. It's brand NEW! We ran 3 test brews on the middle cup: poured 12 oz, then 8 oz, then barely 4 oz. She then tells me it's defective and to send it back. What a terrible product! No thank you."
"As a college student, coffee is mandatory to function. Before the K55, I was a casual drinker. After the K55, I find myself attending rehabilitation for my newly developed chronic coffee addiction. The K55 is one of the most powerful man made tools ever invented. Being able to slide a cup under it, place a pod in, and press a button for my instant coffee fix makes it increasingly difficult not to be drawn in after getting off work. Even as I write this review, I can see the blue lights from the kitchen from the buttons. It speaks to me. I have to wrap this up, I've got a cup waiting."
I'm so in love with my single cup k!! No waste and makes great coffee tea and hit chocolate or cappachino!! Best coffee pot I've ever owned!! If and when this one wears out I'm getting another! Thanks guys!!
I'm a little disappointed.  I had one of the original Keurigs and it definitely made a better cup of coffee.  This one tastes somewhat watered down so I've found I have to purchase the dark and bold cups to get close to what I like in a cup of coffee.  I expected better.
The Keurig K55 Coffee Maker works great. I like the reservoir as I used to have the kind where I had to pour the 8 ounces of water in the tank before each brew cycle.
Biggest piece of junk I have ever bought on Amazon-worked for about a month-then stopped working-cleaned it twice thinking it was our water-the water never would drain from the holder to the tank-the button on the bottom of the holder is keeping the water from going into the tank-we messed with it and it finally worked for about 3 days-then stopped working again-very frustrating to expect a cup of coffee in the AM and having to deal with this.  Going to go buy a regular machine. will return this and hopefully get my money back
But this as a present for my mom and she absolutely loves it! Thanks again Amazon Prime for always given us the good stuff we need to make others tomorrow! I would recommend this product for others!
I love my Keurig! It works with other brand which is one of the main features I was looking for.  While it only has three cup size choices I am very satisfied with it. I love that the water container holds more water than my previous one.
"I wanted a Keurig for my dorm room and I'm so glad that purchases this one. Works exactly like I need, has all the feature I need, and works beautifully *on a side not I recommend Dunkin Donuts Chocolate Glazed Donut Coffee*"
Bought this one to replace a previous Keurig we had for about 10 years or so. Absolutely sold on the Keurigs. I refuse to be without one. Works great!
Bought this for my fiancee and she loves it and so do I! Don't mind the bad review's this version is one of the best model's of the Keurig and you can use custom filter for it no problem at all. I highly recommend this product!
"k55 For the Win! by reading the comments i see that there can be negative as well as the is positive comments about this product, but i strongly believe that for the cost of this machine makes it a good investment. At least in my opinion.. mine has lasted more than a year and im now purchasing one for my brother as a birthday gift."
"Received today, set up was easy. Coffee was delicious!"
"I bought this on December 1, 2016 and it is now leaking and not working and it is only April 30th!! I am so disappointed with this product. How can it break in less than 6 months?? I would not recommend it at all. A coffee maker should last more than 6 months without breaking down."
This works well and does accept all types of pods.
"This has been perfect for my small family. A regular pot of coffee was always way too much for just 2 and was too slow for a busy morning, so this is the perfect solution. It is simple to use and oh so quick. My 10 year old loves using it for hot chocolate too. Couldn't be more pleased."
I love it! So easy and can't imagine life without my Keurig now.
"I love this product but am once again disappointed. In the three weeks I have had it, it has already started pouring cups that are not full. This is the reason I am on my third K55. Guess I should have learned my lesson by now."
"This is the second Keurig system I've purchased, and by far, the best.  I like this K55 because it works with all k-cup type pods.  Some of the new Keurig products only work with Keurig pods.  Great product!"
"I would have given this 5 start, but the brew volume is off. Sometimes you get a full cup, sometimes you get 3/4 of a cup. And it brews very loud. I've have one once before, an upgraded version of this one and it wasn't nearly as loud. And it was even brewing."
This was a replacement for ours that died.  Based on all of the reviews I read this model had the best rating so we bought it.  I is faster and quieter than our old one.
"Love the product.  Cost the same as store model but hey, I didn't have to go out and spend time in the traffic.  I love a good cup of coffee at night and this is a perfect unit for that."
"Have had one of these for years, until it needed to replaced.  Ought the same bc I loved it. Purchased 9/16 and in 3/17 it would no longer brew a full cup. It had only been 6 months. Researched and did all solutions offered, cleaning needles, brewing with white vinegar but the problem continued. Contacted Keurig directly and after a lot of haggling, and them telling me the short coffee was brewing the correct # of ounces. Had to argue, I've been using the same cup for the previous Keurig and would get a full cup. Also got full cup with this one until 3/17 when the issues started. Finally, they offered me a replacement but want me to send part of the defective brewer bk. I said sure send me label so that won't cost me anything. They said they had no way to do that. I argued, why should I have to purchase a quilted envelope and pay for shipping? Solution offered: they are going to send me 2, 5 cup sample packs of the same coffee I drink. Coupon they first offered, that I could use on their website, I declined bc then I'd have to pay shipping!Sad that Keurig appears to have gone downhill.New one to arrive 5/7 business days and I've got to go to the post office and send this part bk. I'll update this review if all is well with replacement after many months. One star bc I had to argue with them for 1/2 hr to get where I am now, and they lied stating it was only to brew 10 oz. when it used to brew 14. Finally won argument when I told her to look at the pic of the large coffee cup on the cover of the use and care guide, and the pic showed brewed coffee to the top."
I like this classic coffee maker because it holds enough water that you don't need to refill between each cup when hosting a small group. Each cup of coffee is good and I don't have to worry if it's getting too strong because the coffee is not continually heated.
"I purchased this as a gift for my mom. She absolutely loves it! The packaging was secure, the product intact and the final results she claims are ""delicious"". I must note it can be quite loud while making the coffee, but otherwise I find nothing wrong with this Keurig model."
Works really well. It would be better for me if it had 12 and 16 oz buttons but works well.
"Works well.  Had a regular coffee maker before which is less expensive in terms of coffee cost, but better flavor with the single cup brew.  Also got the brew pod that you can put bulk ground coffee into to beat the cost of the K-cups.  It works well but you have to dump out the grounds and rinse each time."
Works well and not as noisy as the older model.  Very satisfied.
I had a Keurig that I purchased last spring and it started to act up. I did my research on decided to purchase this one on amazon. I'm very happy that I did.  I hope it last a lot longer that the previous one did. My first Keurig lasted 10 years or more..
It broke in a few months
My birthday present to me ... I love it ????????????????????????????I'm to lazy to wash the regular coffee makers everyday so this is perfect
"I had ordered one of these for my Son at Christmastime and his Wife liked it so much, when my coffee pit needed replaced I thought I would get one also!! Simple to use, great seller!!"
"Quieter than my ""original"" Keurig from years and years ago, but not as ""heavy"" or well-built.  Has several features my old unit didn't have, so we'll see how long this one lasts.  Love my Keurig and the pods I purchase through the Amazon Subscribe & Save Program.  I'd say 4 1/2 stars!"
LOVE IT!! Buying another for the workshop.
I'm on my third Keurig coffee maker.  I continue to buy these because of the convience & the variety of coffees available. DO NOT EXPECT IT TO LAST TWO YEARS and probably not that long.  My kitchen faucet filters water & the keurig fliter is in place.  Durability is really poor.
"The reason that I went with the K55 was because it states that this model is made in the USA . . .  just received the package and opened it up, and on the box and also on the bottom of the coffee maker it states that it is made in China . . .  I don't appreciate false advertising and I don't appreciate products made in China."
"Older models would start brewing coffee as soon as the button was pushed. This model requires a number of seconds to 'boot up' before it brews. Also, and even a bigger disappointment to me, when the ""fill water"" indicator is off, meaning it has enough water for a brew, I expect the brew to happen; with this model, if the water level is low the fill water light will come on after the brew button has been pushed and the brewing will stop. Old models would always have enough water for at least one brew before the indicator light would come on. Otherwise, seems to be a solid machine."
"I bought this Keurig maker about a month ago before I moved into my new house. I was very excited because this is our first home that we were able to purchase! I've always wanted a keurig,as we have 2 at work and they are awesome! However, when I received my Keurig, it has been malfunctioning. It doesn't brew the right size when it's selected and sometimes it doesn't brew at all! I looked into the new touch screen keurig, but I felt the one I purchased should be sufficient enough, as I've heard nothing but great things about Keurigs. A little disappointed in this as it wasn't the cheapest product. I was looking forward to a perfect cup of coffee, every time..."
"Coffee is extremely weak, even on the strongest setting.  My wife was making a cup the other day and as I watched the coffee coming out of the machine into her cup it was so watery I actually thought she was making tea.  It makes a cup in 19 seconds flat, which is the problem.  The water has to touch the coffee grounds at least a little bit to extract the coffee.  Horrible product!"
"Had this only a few weeks. Using it for my weekend brews currently, and no complaints about the prep or taste. I only hope this lasts and outlives its rival 10 year old 4-cup Mr. Coffee drip, which provides us weekday morning cups."
"I keep buying this for the convenience but those who say it soon stops dispensing water in expected amounts are correct. An area impossible to get to gets clogged and there is no practical way to clear it. I guess it keeps us buying the product. Therefore, every few months I buy another."
I bought this for my parents for Christmas. It is extremely easy to operate. I'm very glad this Keurig has the option for a tall cup because most K-Cups are strong (in my opinion). I liked this so much I bought me one.
"Worked for two months.  Stopped working.  The Medium cup light, Fill water light, and heating light stated flashing.  Followed all recommendations I found online.  Unplugged for extended period and it worked a few times.  During the few timed I got it to work I ran vinegar through it to de-scale.  Next morning wouldn't work again.Called Keurig and they replaced the machine.  Excellent customer service."
"I bought a different brand coffee maker last year; the pump wore out in one stinkin' month. For the same money this Keurig is heavier, sturdier, and has made 100 times as many cups of coffee, with no signs of any problems."
"I have had this for ONE MONTH and it is not working.  In fact, it is doing the same thing my old Keurig was doing when we had to replace it,  a Keurig that we had used without incident for more than 3 1/2 years. Believe the bad reviews. We will not be replacing this with another Keurig,  and although it is still under warranty,  I'm not sure it is worth dealing with."
I'm disappointed in this machine. It isn't working properly. Sometimes the water won't come out of the machine. The machine runs like it is trying to fill the cup but doesn't. Sometimes an ounce or two will come out. This is the first Keurig product I've ever had trouble with.The photo shows the amount that came out of the machine for a medium cup.
I love the convenience but my last one broke at the 2year mark.  I really took care of it and it broke anyways.  I tried every trick to revive it.  Buy it at bed barth and beyond and then you can return it easily.  much easily.
Pretty good device for instant coffee (at least close to). My one complaint is that it seems as though each setting for coffee mug size is a tad bit too small.
We purchased this item used and it works as expected.  The machine arrived without an instruction manual and no packing material inside the box.  We had an issue with the machine not filling properly but its seems to have corrected itself.  So far so good.
"If you like STRONG espresso style coffee at home , this is it!  Experiment with different blends and you can find some that are like getting espresso at some expensive café.  Of course it makes good regular coffee too."
"We bought two of these - pen for us and one for our son. We've both had problems with them. For some reason the motor run after the coffee has brewed. I'm not referring to the heater which I would expect to run. You have to turn it off, wait and then you can turn it back on. In the past year we've gone through 4 Keurigs. This is the last one ever. No longer a fan."
I like Keurig but this model is very cheaply made compared to my prior one.  I'm very disappointed.
"This is my second Kuerig unit. The first one still works great after 10 yrs, but was getting noisy so I donated it to a local church. Love this coffee maker!!"
"This is the fourth Keurig we have purchased, the others have been a little more expensive models.  The tank seems a little smaller than the others, the cover is not hinged so when adding water you have to remove the whole cover and set aside, and there is no light under tank so you can't see the water level just by glancing at it.  Things we can live with and are happy with it considering the lower price.  It is much quieter than the K525 which I returned as it would wake everyone up in the morning."
"One thing we can't live without is our Keurig! We bought this as a ""spare"" just in case our other one stops working. They last for years if you take care of them. We've always like the three size option."
I am one of the Keurig hold out people. I have held out and not bought one of these thinking it was a frivolous purchase and kinda stupid to be honest. I really love coffee so finally gave in and decided to try this whole deal. OMG I freaking love this thing. Making coffee in a coffee maker or peculator (I love Cuban coffee) is a chore compared to this! Your coffee is done in 2 minutes. I don't even have anywhere to be and I still love how fast this is! If you have been holding off.....DO IT!
"LOVE IT!  This product is enjoyed by my entire family.  Because I am the only coffee drinker in my household, it did not make since to make a pot of coffee.  This product allows me to enjoy my coffee and the rest of the family to enjoy the beverage of their choice.  I have had the Keurig K55 for almost a month and have been enjoying it thus far."
Quit working after 6 weeks!
"Only gave it a 4 star, waiting to see how long it lasts.  Also causes me to drink more coffee because it's so handy.  I also use aftermarket cups with two tea bags in them to make excellent 8oz. hot teas."
This is an upgrade for me since I have had the smaller version for years and didn't want to spend the money for the bigger one.I am so glad I did.  It is so convenient and makes good hot coffee instantly.
"If you want the best without all the bells and whistles, this keuriq coffee maker is for you.  I like that you don't have to buy special pods to fit.  I got this back in December and am very happy with it."
"Works great!  Good coffee, good size water reservoir, quick!"
It's a bit noisy when it brews but it makes a perfect cup of coffee.
"Works great! I love that I'm not wasting a whole pot of coffee in the mornings anymore. It is kind of loud though, makes me think the thing is going to lift off into outer space... but it's a great coffee maker."
"Great machine !I have had several of these Kerrigan K -cup machines and have been very happy with them.So happy in fact that  I bought this machine as a spare, in case my current machine failed.I don't know what I would do without my Keurig.Thanks, Keurig"
still getting used to it - it isn't strong enough tastes like coffe water
Do not buy this model! I am on my second replacement since January. The Keurig stops sensing that the Water reservoir is in place and will not function.  Keurig will only replace it with the same defective model or with one that only uses Kcups. I cannot get a refund as I purchased it from Amazon. I am very disappointed not only in the product but also in the fact that I cannot get my money back.  Keurig would rather send me multiple defective Keurigs instead of just giving me a refund. Doesn't make sense!
"The top wont stay open.  I have to avoid the needle coming down on my hand every time I use it.  I'm so disappointed, this was a huge added expense for me and I wish I stayed with my old coffee maker."
I love the convenience of brewing one cup at a time instead of a half a pot.  I got one of the first machines that came out but I didn't care for the no option on the cup size. This one is heaven sent.
Do not buy this item.  It has a plastic ring where the K-cups sit and it has a foul smell and the coffee and tea still taste nasty after several cups.  Amazon should pull this item off.
I have purchased at least one of these annually for family members.  They work and do the job quickly and efficiently.  The K cups can get expensive.  Use amazon or a wholesale club purchasing case count.
too bulky for me but may work for others
"This machine was replacement for one we had for over 5  years.First, this model is notably cheaper and flimsier.It has worked well for 4 months but now gets stuck with fill water and heating light on.  The water is full to the line so it does not need more and cannot need to heat forever.  The only way to reset the unit is to unplug it.  Then it usually works for a cup or two before locking up again."
Lasted a little over a year then stopped working.  Consider getting the extended warranty if you plan to  use it daily for over a year.
"I had postponed buying this because I didn't want this to be a ""fad"". But oh I love thisachine so much. Instantaneous coffee, reminds me of when we used to always have a  BUN coffeemaker. But since it's just me now, I don't like to waste coffee by making too much. This is 1 cup when I want, always fresh. Love it."
"I am in love with my Keurig! This is very practical and useful for someone on the go. This device saves me at least 10 minutes when getting ready in the morning. I show up for work 10 minutes early now...thanks, Keurig!!!"
"Other reviewers have had issues...I will update my review if I experience any problems but here's where it stands after 8 wks....This was purchased as replacement for my previous Keurig which gave me 6 very good years of service. This model has the same features as my previous version although some of those features have been upgraded. I brew 2-3 cups per day, coffee only. I use a combo of kcups + an eco friendly refillable kcup for specialty brews.  The new machine works great! No problems at all. The convenience remains awesome. I'm really happy the portion sizes have been adjusted (compared to my previous  version) so a large is truly a large now.I only use purified water so not sure the filter is necessary but it is comforting.  Also, with previous machine & this one, once a month I run a cycle of vinegar water thru it (followed by a number of water only cycles to rinse). Have never used the approved cleaning solution & never had a problem with taste, portion size, etc."
"Let me start by saying this product works well and is exactly as described. If you are looking for a solid, nice looking Keurig that accepts reuseable k-cups - this machine is for you.Here is the thing: I like a good cup of coffee. I mean a really good cup of coffee. One might even call me a coffee snob. And there is probably an episode of Portlandia inspired by coffee snobs like me. I like to think I could give Agent Cooper a run for his money.Does any of this sound like you? If so... DO NOT BUY A KEURIG!!!The main reason we bought this thing was because of the amount of coffee we'd end up pouring down the sink with our normal pot (the hubby and I are down to one cup a day). We thought buying a single-serve Keurig with reusable k-cups was the perfect solution. And maybe it is if you plan to use the pre-filled store-bought cups (not an option for us); however, the reusable k-cups by default make a super watered down cup of coffee. Bleck!After A TON of trial and error I've figured out a hack* to make a pretty good cup of coffee using local beans and the reusable k-cups. However, it was proceeded by a ridiculous amount of terrible cups of coffee first.Hindsight 20/20, I should have just stuck with the french press or bought a pour over.In sum: 3 stars for my experience, 4 or 5 stars for the actual product.* If you are interested in the hack I found, let me know and I can post a link here for you."
"Purchased this coffeemaker to replace my original Keurig which finally died after 3 years.  Love how this unit preheats the water, so it takes just a few seconds to brew a cup of coffee."
"I bought this coffee maker for our weekend home. We used twice before it quit working, Unfortunately the return window has expired and we have to go back to our Mr. Coffee single serve Kcup machine."
This is the worst piece of appliance!!  It has never worked well since we purchased in July and this was the second one.  DO NOT BUY!! It makes coffee one day and not the next.  You have to clean out every needle and then it might or might not work.
Performs as you expect without all the propriety blocks the newest models have tried to implement. Just wish it could on more size larger in a serving but then that would thin out a drink too much anyways.
I bought the same model that I was replacing.  When I got the new one it was not the same.  The cup sizes were smaller and just looked cheaper...
"Works well.  Replaces an older model.  This model has many more plastic parts than my older model, though.  So long as it lasts a few years, that's all I am expecting."
"Best coffee maker ever. Makes single cups so fast that it can keep up with 2 or 3 people. No measuring, and no cleanup, and no preparation to speak of. Simple to use. I have had no problems with the machine at all."
I was pretty skeptical about buying a Keurig because I don't really drink coffee often. To my surprise there are tea pods! I use my keurig at least once a day and I can't find anything bad to say about it.
The K55 is an essential part of our kitchen and we use it every single day. No problems yet! It is a little loud but it does it's job well and that's all that matters.
"Been using this Keurig for a couple of months now and it's awesome. Water heats up quickly, coffee is made quickly. Definitely happy with it. The only downside is that while some of the bottom part comes out for cleaning, there's still a piece of plastic down there that means I can't fit my travel mug under it. But I'm not sure if that's because there's not enough room for my travel mug or if I just have a large travel mug, so I just fill up a normal mug twice and dump it into my travel mug and it's all good."
broke soon after i received it
I have had this Keurig for 2 months - I have absolutely loved it but now it's starting to gurgle and not work correctly - arghh!
"I am sure it is a nice product. However, it is a very large machine. Very invasive on a kitchen counter."
Works great! I bought this to replace an older model that lasted five years. This model is a little noisier during the heating cycle but otherwise does a nice job. I will update this review after I have had it awhile.
"Was very happy with this high end coffee maker. The price was exceptional. I truly did not expect to pay such a reasonable price for this item. I am very pleased with it. It did not come with a manual. I simply went to YouTube and typed in the coffee maker number listed on the bottom of he coffee maker and several videos came up to show me how to operate, replace filter and clean coffee maker. Don't have to worry about lost instructions!! Awesome."
"I like my K55. I really like that I can use a filter and have my folgers decaf coffee every morning without buying the pods, hubby drinks regular 2 cups in the morning, so the K55 is for me during the week. The only drawback is, it could have a bigger water container, but I guess 48 oz is better than others."
I have had this product for 1 and a half months and it broke. Keeps saying needs water although its full and we have emptied it out and cleaned it no help will not make a cup of coffee. Now I can not find anything that will let me return it so I guess I am out $100.00 :-(
I use this for a club I am in. I makes having coffee there so easy compared to our old 40 cup coffee pot! It has been easy to use and totally reliable. This is the most common model I see at work and in public places as it is very simple to use.
Sometimes when I brew it comes out as a slow trickle.  Other times it works fine.  Yes I clean it regularly and I still have this issue.  It started doing this the second week I had it.  I have only had it a month and it does this a couple times a week at least.
Great item; I wish the reservoir were larger.
"Our old K55 finally died after 3 years of constant use.  I refuse to reward Keurig for their 2.0 product line by upgrading.  DRM is for software, not coffee.  When the 1.0 is no longer available, I'll be a french press user again."
"So far, so good.  Plastics leave a little to be desired, but given the price I'm not too surprised.  This thing will kick a cup of coffee out in 30-45 seconds so it is a great option for those on the go."
"Unfortunately, our old Keurig (B70 Platinum Series) is out of warranty and constantly just dripping out water and saying ""descale"" all the time so we had to get a new one.  The good news is that the cup of coffee is hot ... that bad news is that for the price, everything is made of plastic and definitely looks like it won't last very long.  The vendor was fine, the delivery was fine .... guess just disappointed in what Keurig is putting out these days!"
"Easy to set up and use. I use the basket to put my own coffee in instead of using the premade coffee containers. The coffee is good, but not as good as when I make a full pot. It is super quick to brew one cup though."
"the best one cup at a time coffee maker we have had.  the coffee turns out hotter, but I still put it in the microwave for 20 sec., because I use cold milk....I like my coffee ""hot""."
"Avoid buying this product.  Received January 10th.  Stopped working January 19th.  Called Keurig and they seemed to be aware of this issue and would send a repair part.  4 weeks later no repair part.  Called Keurig and they said the part was on back order and we'll receive it sometime in the latter part of March.  Horrible product and service.  I've purchased Keurigs now for the last 10 years...seems like I'm replacing them every year or so, but this takes the cake....broke in just over a week and 2 bad service experiences."
"This Keurig is fantastic. I had a single cup for years,but it started breaking down. Started to get grounds in my coffee. Time for a new Keurig. This is a pre- 2 series. In other words it will take any and  all K-cups. Not to big,and i am used to the reservoir now,and it is pretty cool. I really like this machine and definitely recommend it. Great Keurig !!!"
"Good basic brewer.  Fairly small water capacity compared to Cuisinart brewer it replaced.  Top for water reservoir was scratched, but doesn't affect functionality."
"We bought this brewer to replace a 12 year old Keurig brewer which was starting to show its age. It works as well as the older brewer and has some important improvements.Pros: Make a good cup of coffee or other beverage. It is much quieter  that the older brewer. It heats the water and brews a cup much quicker than the older brewer.Cons: It has no clock. (You cannot set it to turn on by itself.) It has no light to show water level in reservoir. You cannot adjust water temp. That being said, I find the new brewer is better than the last. None of these things are/were a deal breaker for me.(We have a single cup Keurig brewer at our vacation home and it also works well. You just cannot beat the speed and convenience of the Keurig brewers.)"
The machine works great.  I bought this to replace an old silver model.  It works as it should.  I do miss the lcd screen and the reservoir light that flashes when tank is low.  I wish I spent the extra 20 for those features.  It is still a great machine.
"It only last 4 months, no water comes out any more, this is the 2nd one I buy in less than 1 year"
Bought it as a spare since our old one is starting to sound like a grinder.
It was delivered August 19 and just stopped working today.  My window to return it has passed.  I am not pleased.
Been way behind on the keurig train so finally got one.. got here in 2 days highly recommend. Already had a cup and it was perfect. Came with sample kcups and a water purifier just a great purchase
"I'm not sure if I was shipped the wrong item, or if this is false advertising, but this is most certainly not ""programmable"".  There's an auto off button that you can push so that it turns off 2 hours after brewing, but that's all. I was expecting a way to set it up so that when I go down in the morning it's already warmed up and ready to bre (like my old model). But it ain't so :(. Longest minute of my life waiting for the warmup!"
"We have used a different model Keurig for years, but very disappointed in this model. I had to return 2 Keurigs in a matter of weeks.  After a few days of use, each machine stopped pumping water out. I am asking for a refund and will try another model; maybe this model does not perform as well as others."
This thing is great. It's quick. It's easy. Very convenient.
"I like this machine because of the convenience it gives me. I wake up place a item of choice in the Keurig place a cup under the spout an push a button. Less than a minute later I'm drinking the flavor I want. Now, if only I can get it to hand me the cup."
"We liked this so much that we bought one for my in-laws too...great price, works well.  Not too many ""features"" that many newer models have which we do not want and would not use."
"I bought it as a gift for a family member.  I decided to purchase one of the new, but repackaged ones because of the price.  Won't do that again  because only 5 cups of coffee made and it quit working.  Boy was I embarrassed!!!  Amazon didn't have another to sell for the price that I originally paid.  I could get a refund but no replacement my only option was to contact Keurig for help."
Gave this as a Christmas present they really seem to like it.
Very quick to heat up water and instructions were clear. Does the job well with hassle-free
Love this thing. It's been few days I have had this and been using it a lot. Doesn't take very long to warm the water. Put in the kcup and get your coffee.Only thing I wish was that there was little more cup space. I can't fit my mug. I remove the bottom tray to fit the mug in there. That's the only negative.
I absolutely cannot be without this machine. As a coffee drinker I was always having to clean up after the mess of regular coffee makers. This is perfect for just the right sized cup of coffee.
"Love my new Keurig!  Never had one.  Not a big coffee drinker, so it's super nice to be able to make one cup at a time...  So happy I finally broke down and purchased one  :-)"
"Cheap version of Keurig, Costco has a nicer one for the price"
HAd the smaller one and asked for this one for Christmas. Great upgrade.
"Didn't last 4 months!!! It will only drip a couple of drips, then acts like it's done."
Great purchase - only downside is now I drink more coffee because it is so convenient to brew!
"Worst purchase every, does NOT make a decent size cup of coffee no matter how much I watch it.  I want to return this machine, but obviously I am way past the point of no return.  Pulling out my Mr. Coffee pot, its better to waste a cup or to then to be totally frustrated waiting for a decent cup produced from the Keurig."
"Mother in Law loves it! Converted her from a coffee pot to this. She's by herself, so now that she likes it so much, she dumped the old coffee pot, and normally only makes 1 cup. So, works perfect for her!"
"It took my wife over a year top get me to purchase a Keurig. Honestly, with the cost of these K-cups I think I'll go back to my French Press sooner rather than later."
It's perfect for my needs. I'm glad that it has an automatic shut-off just in case I forget to turn it off myself. I also like the fact that I can use regular ground coffee ( I purchased the K-Cup adapter)and don't have to use the K-Cups - which are so expensive.
"Just what he expected, but had to take out the filter. It seemed to slow/clog the water. Our water is filtered anyway, so he just took it out and now it works just great, makes great coffee."
"Great product.  Produces very hot coffee so quickly.  Watch the pod prices though and wait for sales, buy in bulk."
"It's such an easy and convenient compliance to use. Saves me a few minutes every morning, which is wonderful.I bought the reusable coffee pod so I can still sip my favorite coffees."
"Not a K55!!!!!!!!!!!! Returned after 3 Cups!! Stopped working . Looked on bottom metal plate Stamped K40, a unit that was discontinued.. Was packaged as K55. Was replaced by ANOTHER K40 packaged as a K55 updated unit.  Keurig deception??????? Dumping older K40??"
This is my first Keurig and I am very pleased. It works as expected...fast and easy to use. It makes great coffee. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend the K55 to friends and family.
"Love this keurig. Can use any kcups. I had a k475. It was nice but you had to use specific keurig k cups that the machine ""read"". If they were not the right cups....No coffee."
"it is small enough to go in a corner. makes coffee fast, easy to use.  wish I had bought it sooner.  great for one or 2 people, no waist of coffee at all. use my own coffee in the reusable mesh cups. have already saved money."
SImple but great machine.
What a great coffee maker!  It gives you a choice for three sizes for a cup of coffee.  The water reservoir is a nice feature so you don't have to refill every time you make a cup. Still researching for a good brand of decaf.
"This little machine gets the work done in no time. If you are in a hurry and need that morning coffee, this is the product for you!! It's a quick setup with easy to understand instructions. No mess and no hassle! Love it!!"
The bottom where the water supply connects broke and we super glued it... not sure why that wouldn't be a stronger material or design for that connection.
"I love my Keurig. Bought it for my boyfriend for Christmas but I've used it more lol. I just realized I said my Keurig. Oh well, I love it! Haven't had any problems with it so far. I am very happy with it and I use it everyday so it's very convenient since it only takes a few seconds to make coffee! Very pleased!"
Replaced a smaller unit which failed and was reimbursed from warranty.Wife love it.  I don't drink Coffee... so more for her than me.
I bought this discounted - used. Every time we brewed a cup the water in the reservoir leaked on the counter. I'm sure Keurig has a good product. I just had a seller try and push a broken item.
"Bought this May 26, 2016. It stopped working August 20, 2016. I'm over Keurig. This is my 4th one. They are not built to last and using the coffee you have to buy for these machines ends of costing too much in the long run."
Works great but I am not a fan of water reservoir lid :/Annoying kid my previous kuerig had a flip lid this lid is not Andi definitely don't like it.
"My daughters Christmas present, she loves the Keurig!!!!"
Great coffee maker. We had the previous version for several years before it finally stopped working and replaced it with this newer version. It makes great coffee.
"Works fine for now.  I've had three of these break in the past, two in less than a year.  Hope the quality of this one is better, but it looks the same out of the box."
"Had my original K55 for 6 years, loved it until it dropped dead last weekend. Got my new one yesterday and noticed what others have been saying. It's a horse of another color.  The top of the drip pan went from metal to plastic, and the size id just enough off so I can't use the metal from the old one (boo hoo). But it heated up very quickly, and made a great cup of Joe.  So my daughter and I agreed that if it last 1/2 as long as the old one we'll be happy."
"Great device! I never drank coffee before this, but it makes it much simpler and quicker for a single cup. I like to do half coffee and half hot chocolate."
"Water reservoir is very  small, only had it 5 months and it's not brewing a full cup and taking way to long to brew.  Very cheap model."
"I've had this product for less than two months. It worked fine for one month brewing two to three cups a day. About a week ago it started brewing around 1/4 a cup no matter what setting I had. I've reviewed multiple you tube videos and it seems this can be a problem on many models, usually a year or more into use. None of the posted solutions have worked. It currently takes three to four brew cycles to produce a cup."
"i went from a regular old coffee pot to this amazing little thing! it's wonderful, brews a perfect cup every time and it's exactly what i wanted. would 100% recommend!"
Packaging: Packaged wellValue: Good valuePros: Easy to set up and useCons: Slight smell but once washed with soap and water the smell went awayBuy again?: Yes
This is our third Keurig - the only thing we do not care for is you cannot program it for a time in the morning to start the warming process.  Our old model had this feature.
Disappointed.  Purchased March 27 and stopped working June 10th(my birthday of all days).  I was really enjoying this coffee maker until stopped working.  The water component doesn't appear to be working get a few drops in the cup then it quits.  Tried turning it off and on and took the water sleeve off and put it back on nothing worked.  My sister has had hers for years w no issues.
This is one of the most important items I have purchased.  The coffee maker works great and it brews the coffee better than I had imagined.  Definitely worth the money and the wait.  I received it fairly quickly and it so easy to set up.
My wife wanted to curate coffee maker but one used didn't work right tried a smaller version didn't satisfy her I bought this one. (If mama ain't happy ain't nobody going to be ) mom is happy so I'm I.
"Works as advertised, I have had it for a couple months and use it almost daily with no problems. I like it enough that I just bought the commercial version for my business as well."
"I had two of these machines for more than 3 years, of heavy usage.  When one of them finally went into retirement, I started looking around and reading reviews of different k-cup machines, each one promising better taste, better speed, more types of brew settings, etc, etc.  I bought a cuisinart and returned it, and then a bunn, and then returned it.  They were either too loud, vibrated too much, or had the fill chamber in an inconvenient location or you had to completely remove the k-cup holder, dripping liquid everywhere.  Then I realized that the original Keurig machine was the standard by which all others are measured.  So I got the K55.  Everything is very convenient, easy to fill, very quiet (I have to look at the machine and make sure it is working, as it is so quiet).Don't fall for the hype of getting something else.  Just get the Keurig machine and rest easy.  It will be no fuss, no muss, easy setup and consistent operation for years on end."
"I purchased this for my husband for father's day, and we loved it while it worked -- which was about six months of very light use.  My husband is pretty handy, but he can't fix it.  Very disappointed.  Now to see how the company stands behind their warranty."
"This machine finally died after four months of problems. First, I had to clean it with vinegar too often. Then it could barely brew two ounces. Then it wouldn't work at all."
Had my first one last for 7 years and when it broke I replaced it with this one.
"So far, so good.  Can make multiple cups in a row.  Water stays hot for up to two hours.  Easy to use.  Can adjust for different sized cups."
"Easy to use, makes great coffee. Only problem is it doesn't get the coffee very hot"
We own a Keurig and it is in our kitchen. I bought this smaller version for my upstairs office. But after only two weeks this model began to malfunction. Very disappointing. I may have to return for a refund as it is within Amazon's 30 day guarantee.
"I'm a huge fan of the Keurig, we have one in our office that is used at least 5 times a day with no trouble.  This particular one was purchased for my dad for Christmas though and it just died :(  He makes 1 cup a day so it's not like it sees heavy activity.  It's been properly descaled and all that goes along with that, but it just won't perk the water thru anymore.  I feel so bad that I gave him this!"
It works great! Had it a for only a few months but that was long enough to convince my parents to get one. Of course they had to get the newest one. But this one makes the exact same coffee for half the price.
"We were skeptical when we purchased the Keuring, but I would trade it for anything. Easy and quick to use. We love trying the different flavors of coffee, tea, and hot chocolate"
"I am disappointed, I have had this product for only 6 months and it has stopped working, I can't get the light to even come on. Working just fine, then stopped. Very disppointed after only having this for 6 months and paying $100 for one. Can this be replaced somehow with an expense to me?"
"I purchased the first one and it worked for about 2 weeks, then stopped.  After it heated, the motor just seemed to run continually, but nothing would happen.  So I exchanged it, thinking we just got a lemon.  Now we've had the second one and it is doing the same thing.  Very frustraing and disappointed in this product."
This is not the first Keurig I have owned. I always use k-cups made for the machine. After owing this unit for two months the motor broke. Would not recommend this machine
"I like this Keurig better than the 2.0. But the original Keurig was bigger and held more water than this one. However, this Keurig does make hotter coffee than the 2.0"
I'm very unhappy with this coffee maker. I purchased this Keurig June 29th and it quit working the November 2nd.
"4 stars because the box came open and broken.  Other than that, the product inside is fine."
Great price. Works well and includes a bonus set of k cups and filters.
"Bought in April 2015, Unit shorted out in June 2015. Just as the return offer passed. Go for something else.......I am pissed. I enjoyed the unit, but it could have caught my home on fire!"
"I've finally jumped on the keurig train and I am so happy I have! It is easy to use and much more affordable than a $5 cup of coffee. I love the variety of k cup options out there and the sleek, modern design of the coffee maker."
"The model is the one I ordered, however, I ordered a new one and this one is clearly used. Even had one of the coffee pods missing. Disappointing to pay full price for a used coffee maker......"
My husband is in LOVE with his Father's day gift! It arrived on time and in great shape. This is definitely the gift that keeps on giving!
I upgraded from the old Mini Keurig to this finally and for the money it just can't be beat. The built-in water filter is a really cool concept and other than that it just works great!
"Simple. When it comes to Keurig, you don't want all the extras, just a good mechanical working unit for K-Cups/Regular Coffee, for the best price. This is IT!"
easy to use from the very first cup! I bought a variety pack but it came with 4 different k-cups.  i tried Donut shop medium roast 10oz and it was Delicious!  love it already
"Brought this for my Aunt who isn't too tech savvy, but this unit is really simple and easy to use. She had no problem firing up a brew that morning she received it. I give this ""5 Cups of Joe"" review."
"I am not an everyday, or more than one cup, of coffee type of person.  So, this lets me make the cup of my choice without having to make the minimum amount stipulated on my old coffee carafe.  Love it so much, I ordered one for my son and his family to enjoy."
"I love this coffee machine, it is very simple to understand. I will finally be able to have starbucks at home! It was delivered one day before estimated so it made me extra happy!"
Very satisfied. Will do business again with seller :)
"First time owning a Keurig and I love this model. I do need to refill the water somewhat frequently (every 5-6 cups brewed) but the reservoir is removable and easy to refill. This is a perfect for a small kitchen, does not take up a lot of counter space."
It worked well do a couple months nut has now stopped working all together. We have used the filter and purified water since day one but now it won't brew coffee. Very disappointed as it was a Christmas gift for my wife
Works well and is fun to use but I tend to buy one once a year because they do wear down after a lot of use.
I love my Keurig.  I like have fresh coffee whenever I want a cup and not having to have some that has been sitting for a while.
Bought mine in July 2016. It is broke in March 2017.
"Great product.  Only down fall is I can't fit my travel mug under the dispenser.  Even if I remove the spill tray, there is still another platform that prevents it."
"I was happy to receive my new Keurig K55 in one day!. I had one of the first models Keurig came out with and it worked great until this year. My new one is not working and only 3 months old! It is disappointing to  buy a product from a company with an excellent reputation only to have the product break in a very short time.  When the coffee maker works, I love it, but not when it doesn't."
I have had this brewer less than one year and it's already stopped working. It brews maybe 1 tbsp of coffee at a time. I've tried all the tutorials online to clean and fix it and it hasn't helped. There are much cheaper coffee pots you can buy that work much better.
Crapped out after one week. I literally made less than 7 cups of coffee. Turned it on today and it just kept making this buzzing sound. Shut it off and reset several times. Dead. Returning to Amazon. Not sure if I got a lemon. Very disappointed.
"I am usually a fan of Keurig but have recently had difficulty with this model.  I purchased this Keurig for use at our office on June 2, and it is no longer functioning properly.  The daily use for the work week is usually 3-5 cups so it is not being being subjected to unreasonable use.  However in the last couple of weeks began getting a message to add more water when the resevoir is full.  The machine rarely brews as it is supposed to and when it does it is hit and miss.  We have tried unplugging it and plugging it back in, turning it on and off and repeating the brew steps sequence with some limited success but overall it is not functioning properly.  We are disappointed in this Keurig and particularly disappointed in the 30 day warranty.  We expected better!"
"This is our second Keurig; an updated model of our first, that ceased functioning after three years.  Obviously, we like Keurig.  The new model has auto-shutoff and is quieter than the old one, both nice features."
"Love it! No complaints, stop browsing, add to cart now."
"I'm loved it at first,  then it realize it was broken. It would only work when it when it wanted to, and now not at all. It only make two cups of coffee and day, and it waited to buy this coffee pot and it still don't have it."
Works great and makes most acceptable coffee of whatever variety you desire. We are very pleased. Coffee in seconds!
"Love it, works great, fast brew"
Purchased through Amazon.  It is already broken.  Water will not flow to cup.  Heat up does what ist should yet the water does not come out.  Had it 1 month.  Com0lete crap.  Now what?  I didn't take out extended warranty because it was brand new.  Ridiculous. Didn't even get 30 days out of it.
"5 months and won't brew coffee.  brewed on largest setting and it took 3 cycles to get 1 single cup.changed filter, water tank is full and have only used filtered water into the tank.don't buy this junk"
Got what I wanted. Easy and simple. Love that I can make my favorite coffee and have very little to clean up. And I can use whatever kind of coffee I want with the reusable K-cup.
"Brought as a Christmas for my mother how has weakness in both her hands, and she is able to make herself coffee on her own, no more lifting a large coffee pt. She loves it."
"This was a great deal IMO, it was cheaper on amazon at time of purchase than Walmart, plus the prime shipping. It's an early Christmas present for a family member and I'm sure it will be great!"
Our Previous Keurig as amazing and lasted 2 years.. This is  A Piece of junk.  DO NOT BUY IT. It is a cheap imitation of the real thing. What a mess.
"This is also for a birthday gift.  I'm replacing the one he has in his office.  It is probably an original as it's the slowest thing ever and probably hasn't been cleaned.  Only one button works and it truly takes forever compared to the one I have at home.  This should be a really nice change when I make a cup of coffee for him or me at wirj,"
Bought this Keurig a few months ago on Amazon. It's getting harder to find the Keurig's that will still work on all brands of k-cups. This one will work with any brand. So far it's still working well.
It's fantastic. We've had a few other coffee makers and this is the best. My husband bought another for his office at work too. It's a little loud but super fast!
"This keurig is flimsy.  The water crafe doesn't lock in easily, and the isn't as big as our previous version. The pod holder is cheaply put together and doesn't stay up.  This was a purchase to replace one that finally died and wouldn't descale, but I may return this.We didn't act fast enough and are unable to return.  This is a terrible product.  Do not buy it."
Started brewing only half cups after 3 months of use.  Return window only 1 month.
"This machine has been a problem since the first day. It works perfectly maybe 25% of the time, but the rest of the time when you select the largest cup size the water struggles to come out and you only get a few drops. You have to run it three or four times to get the equivalent of a regular cup, and by that time you've either wasted four K cups or have a very gross tasting cup of coffee. Very disappointed in this purchase."
This is my first Keurig coffee maker and I love it. It takes ALL BRANDS OF K-CUPS not just the Keurig brand cups which is more convenient and economical.
Had the K45 and worn the poor thing out over the years.  Was apprehensive about getting the 55 since 45 no longer available.  Got it anyway and it works like a charm.  Didn't need any of the new bells and whistles and this meets basic needs.
"Kuerig K55, waiting for the third replacement!!! Water reservoir does not release correct amount of water. You have to run it 2 or more times to get enough water for one cup of coffee. The second replacement did exactly the same thing. Having to re-box and drive to UPS twice and maybe a third time. Called Keurig and I was told to call them, not Amazon if the third one doesn't work."
"I never thought I would like a Keurig... but now I can't see being without one! The coffee is a bit more expensive per cup, but I get a fresh cup every time, whenever I want one."
Coffee pot received on time and works great. I am so happy to make my coffee again. Gina C
Not as good as my original one which finally lost its' mind and would only brew whatever size cuppa it felt like.gotta have it1  Starbucks Sumatra addict1
Had an older Keurig for 6 years. Loved it. This is the second K55 that I have purchased that stopped working. Never again. Buyer beware of this model. The pumps stop working.
"Simple to use. Well designed.  Saves on time and cleanup, etc.  Large water reserve.  Auto shut off - to save power.  Should have gotten one of these long ago!"
"The coffee maker arrived WET!!! Had obviously been in use very recently, but I would have expected they would make the attempt to dry the parts of the coffee maker. Plus, the drip tray was missing.This was a huge disappointment!"
Nice!
"Loved my other 2 Keurig's but this one has a plastic taste to every cup of coffee. Thought it was just a ""new"" thing and would wear off after a few uses. But, still has that bitter plastic taste 4 months later."
Our Keurig died after 8 years and we didn't want a 2.0 and be boxed into using k cups so we bought this.  We love it.  It's quiet!  Perfect.  The best part is that I can use aftermarket pods in it no problem.
"We gave our old one to our daughter and son-in-law, it was easier to buy a new one than ship the old one to our new location. The one we replaced was the same model, so I guess you would say we were perfectly satisfied."
"Excellent brewer, I'm in the process of returning a K140, which was very loud and the low water alert was defective, This K 55 is perfect and $40 cheaper. Great choice"
Sent this back because wife found one on sale. I love it. Got the same one. It does get noisy at times but that does not bother me.
It has been a great coffee maker! Very easy to use and very quick too. This makes a great cup of coffee in the morning and with little maintenance needed it has made my mornings much easier!
Received a defective unit.  All three brew buttons produced 4oz of coffee.  Amazon is accepting the return and I will try ordering another unit.2nd KEURIG ORDERED--This unit was also defective :(  It started out brewing OK but gradually produced less and less coffee.  When it got to 2 oz of coffee I gave up.  Amazon accepted the return again.  This time I have ordered a different brand K-cup coffee maker.
"I bought this for my high school classroom, and my kids just love it.  It is dependable and it beats the daylights out of the single-serve unit I've been using.  I look forward to this being a workhorse for years!"
Love ?? my keurig!  The coffee is better than Starbucks and certainly cheaper.  All they need to add is a milk frother and it would be even better!
"After a hassle with the delivery and crazy mix up, I still wanted the replacement shipped to me and I'm so glad I did! I love this machine. The best cup of coffee in a matter of seconds"
This machine is the greatest disappointment ever.  The first purchase stopped working after about one week.  Keurig customer service sent a new one after 35 minutes of having to put the phone up to the machine so the rep to diagnose it didn't work by listening to it.  The replacement machine is now -- after 3 days of working -- not working.  We had a Keurig for 4 years that worked great without a hitch.  What's with this model?
"I purchased this as a Christmas gift.  From day 1 it hasn't worked correctly.  Now 3 months after use, you have to push the large cup button 4 times to get half a cup of coffee.  Machine has been cleaned, descaled and rinsed several times.  I would NOT buy this machine again!"
love this coffee maker and bought the refillable K cup device which makes it easy and cheap to use your own coffee.
"Has been a good product for me, easy to assemble, works with keurig products and knock off pods and holds a good amount of water. Makes a great cup of coffee in less than a minute when hot and about 3 minutes when it needs to heat up."
Looks and works great. Like the fact the water stays hot all the time.
My first Keurig K55 did not work at all! The replacement is not much better. Some days it makes and many days it has to be coaxed to get a cup of coffee.
"Love this coffee maker!  Same cup of coffee every time.  One star deduct for the 9oz max size.  Wish this unit had 11-12 oz capacity, but that being the only complaint, recommend this to everyone."
good
Had a Cuisinart kerig first in out camper and it was way to big. We put that in the house. We now use this in our camper and it seems faster then the other. Love my fresh coffee in the morning!!
"Keurig came on time, very well packed as I expected. Nice appliance. Mine broke after 7 years, just suddenly quit brewing. Maybe it was just about time. But I loved my Keurig and I am sure will love this new one also."
I've had my new Keurig for 3 days now and I love it! The product arrived on time and it makes delicious coffee.
"I bought this as a Christmas present for my wife and she loves it! We have tried everything from coffee to ice tea and even hot chocolate, the K55 brews a perfect cup every time."
The coffee maker works great and I would buy another one when I need it. It was listed prime and I received it a day late not a problem but I though you would want to know.
works perfect
"Couldn't live without my Keurig! This is my second Keurig--the first lasted eight years. Love the ease and convenience of the Keurig--no messy pot to clean, no messy grounds. makes life SO much easier."
"Product is good,but inside only has limited accessory, but if you spend $20 more over Costco you can get better model and full accessory !"
Great machine well worth the money. GF can't function without her coffee every morning and this thing makes it quick and easy to get out the door.
"Just bought this item.  Worked about 6 times and now no longer takes water from the reservoir.  Just makes a lot of noise and does nothing.  Took the filter out, added more water, tried everything I could and it just doesn't work.  Not a quality product at all."
I bought this for my daughter for christmas she loves it. I still have my original Keurig from 2004 still works great. I won't purchase any other brand.
"Bought this one to replace mine that after a few years, just wouldn't clean through anymore. Next to my original unit, the handle topush down on the K-cup seems a bit cheaper made than the one I had. However, this new one has larger cup sizes which isreally great! Have had it now for a couple of months, works great."
"Love, love, love LOVE my Keurig K55! Have been using it several times a day, every day for 5 months already and it's still working great. Did I mention I love it?"
"have to use two for one cup of coffee so the savings of switching to a keurig is reduced....however, I like the convenience of it."
This units works well enough; however it always seems to have an issue taking water.  I have to remove and re-seat the water container frequently.
Our old one died after 3 years of hard use. Picked this version because of the selection of cup sizes which is very useful. One we received was brand spanking new and worked fine right out of the box.
Package was laying on its side when delivered against printed instructions of how it was to be positioned. Additionally the package was opened and re sealed prior to my receipt . Very disappointing when I purchased a new keurig. I will be hesitant to purchase this kind of item in the future.
"Excellent product. Works as programmed and is perfect for that ""one"" cup late at night."
"Every thing worked fine for the first 3 weeks but then it sputtered, coughed and would not produce a full cup of coffee.  I read what others had done with the paper clip, etc on YouTube to clear the problem and I did the same.  It worked!  But for how long, I don't know.  I will get some vinegar and clean it, but can hardly believe that this should be necessary after perhaps only 15-20 uses."
I am very UPSET about my purchase.  I have been using this machine for three weeks and now it quit working.  The return window is closed and I feel quite rippped off.  I am a public school teacher and this purchase was supposed to be a treat. I have been using filtered water and the charcoal filter is in place.  A complete waste of my precious money.  DO NOT BUY
"This is my second Keurig. The first one lasted for ELEVEN YEARS! With proper maintenance, these machines can really last. This particular model is perfect, it was priced right."
"This has been an amazing coffee maker. We originally had the one cup maker but man does it make all the difference to have a large water reservoir. Great purchase, very happy coffee drinkers."
purchased as a gift for my son and his family and they love it! Very easy to use and the water reservoir allows you to make several cups before re-filling
"I have wanted a Keurig for a while now and had to get this once it was on sale. I did have some buyers remorse though, as I didn't realize just how wasteful it really is. I should have thought more seriously about this, as there aren't any biodegradable k-cups yet (lets speed that up Keurig). I also saw how cool the new 2.0 model was, but the reviews weren't as good and I don't really need anything more than this (plus, I read there are a bunch of problems w/ use of certain cups). I actually purchased two different types of reusable cups to use with this, and I feel much better about my purchase. I was looking for something fast and easy to make my beverages in the morning, without having to make a pot of coffee every day, or wait for my french press. I will say, I wish this made stronger coffee, that's the one big bummer if you like your coffee strong. Also, it doesn't brew very much at a time, so if you are looking to fill a tumbler, you will have to do it twice. So far so good, it works great and is really quick, which is what I was looking for."
"The unit is good for low to average coffee drinkers.  The largest cup of coffee it produces is 10 oz and we wanted a Larger water reservoir since this unit only holds 48 oz.  We gave the machine to our daughter and purchased a K475 which gives us more options like serving size,  coffee strength, and allows us to brew a mid size pot of coffee."
"Bought this to replace a newer model that died. I love the original models. Hope they never stop making these, not a fan of the new ones."
"Pretty much the gold standard for K-cup brewers.  When you only drink one or two cups of coffee a day, this is the machine you want."
"I got this as a Christmas gift for my father, who now lives alone, and every time I speak with him he mentions how much he likes it!"
"Typical Keurig machine, works as advertised, no mess, easy to use, consistent cup of coffee depending on the pod used."
I like this product but am annoyed that I have to watch YouTube troubleshooting videos to get it to operate.  It should work properly being a new unit.
the only keurig that will take k-cup of any kind!!
Love my Keurig! Fast coffee in the morning and don't have to reheat for a second cup from my French Press.
This is a nicely designed Keurig with basic features and adequate water storage for a two person household.  I returned it only because my wife wanted a unit with more options.  We ended up with a k250
"My Keurig is already malfunctioning, asking me to fill the water when the water is filled to the waterline.  Not sure I would buy again. I ordered my product about 1 month ago and I already need to find a replacement for my coffee! Very disappointed!"
2nd one!  Wore the other out!  Great coffee pot!
Love everything about it but wish there were be an option to have a way to add water a different way but please don't change it.
"Wow, what a difference this machine with water filter system is! Just received unit today, unpacked, put in filter, brewed sample Kcup in less than 15 minutes and the taste is incredible compared to my old Keurig."
I love this thing for my house. we also have the same 1 at work. k cups r expensive but takes any of them and the 2.0 refill reusable one.
"We have only had this for a few days but we are very happy with it.  Fits under the cabinets, is actually smaller than our old coffee maker.  Brews great coffee and hot cocoa.  Just have to decide which brand K-cups we like the best!"
Excellent coffee pot.  I have never had a Keurig but am really enjoying this one.  I like not wasting my coffee by brewing one cup at a time.
"Bought this for my daughter and she loves it.  She has wanted one for a long time and when I found this for the price point we could afford, we ordered it."
I wish I had spent more and got a model with clock and timed automatic starting - so I could have a cup waiting for when I awoke
Great coffee maker love it
Works good. A lot of kcups seem to contain old coffee Bottom cup piercer some times does not go into cup.
Does exactly what you need it to do at a good price. Only complaint was that I had to fix the water tube because it got clogged once.
Nice brewer! Love the K-Cup flavors! Wish they would have made a larger and easier to change water tank.
been using this for more than a year now and never had any issues. works great! only thing is you have to clean itt periodically to make sure the drip is continuous and wont get smudges around the ring. good buy!
"We actually have not tested it out yet but expect it to be fine as our other one, this one is an extra for our RV."
"My wife loves coffee and things that a breeze to use. Well, Keurig checks both of those boxes. She hasn't stopped drinking K-cups. If you want something that is easy to use and has  consistent flavor get it!"
Purchased this because the three-year-old unit I had became clogged with sediment from hard city water.This Keurig K55 worked well right out of box.
"I use distilled water, so I really don't have a need for the water filter. Annoying that it has to be replaced every 2 months, or so."
Love my Keurig! Was hesitant for so long but I am happy with my purchase. The ONLY thing I find odd is that when making a small cup it is sort of watery compared to the larger cups.
Bought this for my wife on her Birthday and she loves it. It's perfect for her since I don't drink coffee and I bought her the filter where you don't have to use the K-cups. She can add her favorite coffee to the machine.
"It stopped working 3 weeks after we bought it and my husband spent considerable time on the phone with Keurig cleaning pins, etc. to make it work again.  Very helpful customer service, but the applicance shouldn't break down after 3 weeks."
I love that this Keurig doesn't require the barcoded pods like some of the others. I also use only filtered water to fill reservoir to help keep the Keurig filter lasting longer.
"Got as a Amazon Warehouse deal ""Scratch and dent"" model. Received item and could even find the scratch. Works as expected."
Don't recommend Keurig products
"It is already broken.  We used the filter, and we use filtered water, but when I go to brew a cup of anything the water, heating, and middle cup just flashes after it make a bit of noise and spews some water back into the reservoir.  I will never be buying Keurig again."
"Had to return. However, no issues. In fact within days of notifying Amazon that it was defective we received another Keurig K55. So far it works great. Thank you for the excellent service. Could not be more satisfied with the manner in which Amazon responded..... Thank You."
"Purchased on November 11th and the  window to return this product closed January 31 ?  The product stopped working on February 11th!  No appliance that cost this much should stop working in 3 months! Very disappointed will not shop Amazon for high ticket appliances in the future, The water pump appears to have stopped!"
"Its just as expected, however, I docked one star because it's kind of noisy when it's not brewing (it intermittently heats the water)."
"Machine works great, the last one only worked for 18 months, hoping this one stays healthy longer. Yes, I cleaned it at regular intervals with descaling solution."
"I know people who love these, so I gave it a shot. I guess I got ""the bad one"", because after 3 months of playing with it and 30 different coffee types, it has yet to give me anything drinkable. I hate it, and I am finished with it. Awful !!!!"
Great coffee maker!!  The price made this  very good value plus came with extra water filters and coffee and tea samples!  Highly recommend.  Shipped and received the same day.
Had to buy a replacement Keurig on the fly.  This is exactly what I wanted and best price around!
"We love this, worth every penny. My husband and i use it all the time working remotely at home, never missing the office pantry coffee during the work hours. Its great!!"
I am quite happy with the Keurig K55 coffee maker. It has been functioning very well and it is simple enough for my sons to make hot chocolate with it. We have a similar unit at work in a break room that has been working for at least 3 years or more. It probably is used 20 plus times during a work day.
"Simply a great product to have. I used to always use the old classic coffee machine and never really thought of purchasing this. But when I did, it really changed my morning routine and made coffee easier and it saved me a lot more time. This should be in every coffee lovers kitchen."
Love Love Love. a lot quieter than my other Keurig -works well with other filters to make your own coffee pods
This item is so simple and easy to use. A monkey could make good coffee with this device! I been going strong with this item for over six months thus far. I really love this coffee maker!
I don't know what the Big Deal is about this coffee maker. I tried several different brands of coffee and the result was a weak tasteless half mug of coffee. I used the the large cup button which gave me 8 ounces. I enjoy one cup of coffee a day (11 ounces). I found the appliance too large for my needs and I didn't find the instructions to be very clear for inserting the filter.
I purchased this about a year ago and the only issues we've had is that the water intake juncture gets plugged up with gunk. Keurig customer service was able to talk us through how to clean it and prevent it from happening in the future.
Used this less than two weeks and the pump went out.  This is my second Keurig. The first I owned lasted for four years so not sure what happened with this model.
This is a wonderful coffee pot for single cups of tea or coffee. It's easy to operate for my disabled brother and he loves it.
Got this for my mom and she loves it. The teas/coffees from keurig also comes out really hot! Much hotter than the ones I've used before.
"worked well, packaging was good but we had to return since the recipient didn't like it. they're more of an old fashioned 12 pot kind of person"
Very upset. Ordered a few weeks before to put under tree for my new husbands gift and broken when he opened up. The heated light did not light so you never know when water is heated. So upset because only gift I gave him for our first Christmas and broken.
"Works fine so far. Does have a tendency to ""spit"" a bit and the end of the brew cycle that requires minor counter clean up."
IT functions as it should ; but it's a little nosier than my last Keurig. I probably should have spent a little more and bought the equivalent of the platinum model that I had before. I got what I paid for.
"I got tired of guests not having the coffee, etc they want. My Keurig is great and I'm experimenting with new beverages as well"
I recently ordered this upgraded model to replace my current one that just stopped working.  So far we like this model.  It seemed that there was a lot involved in the initial set up.  But after that it is easy to use.
Bought this because I already own one and the price was great so I went ahead and ordered a spare before my 2 year old model dies.
"Excellent machine, no problems, and was shipped fast too.  Have several of these, they hold up well."
"My Keurig B70 died after 3.5 years and replaced it with this one (K55). They are very similar, does its job and I'm very pleased."
This Keurig K55 Coffee Maker stopped working within 60 days and now I am unable to return it.  Keurig pots should last longer.  BEWARE of the return policy.  Not a happy customer now.
"This machine is very user friendly, stylishly designed and no more excessive amounts of coffee. Cups can be made to order.A special thank you to the seller from which we bought this coffee maker. Great price, fast shipping, product as described."
I already love this coffee maker. It makes the perfect coffee or cappuccino in such a short time. There are so many flavours. Simply amazing
"We had it for a few months and then it stopped working.  Did a fix off of YouTube which worked, but now it has stopped again.It is now past the date that we can return it with Amazon, so we are out the money.  And a coffee maker."
Works great!
"Very good,simple to use,good price. This is the second one I've purchased and there is now a third option for cup size which is nice."
"Perfect! Received in excellent packaging, looked brand new, functions like brand new. Very happy with this,  great deal!!!! Also, excellent communication. I highly recommend this seller!!"
Don't know how I managed without this product for as long as I did!  Perfect single cup of any beverage of my choice.
"good product, can be bought for less in other places"
"Have had trouble with this Keurig since receiving it December 30,2016. Looked underneath, and fornd this was a Model K-40, and not the K-55 model I  ordered. The K-40 is defective and the trouble is in the electrical and programming sequences. This one sucks!"
"They do wear out, had to get a new one. Works, love the consistency that I could never achieve with drip/mrcoffffeee stuff."
I've had this machine for quite a while the new one is just like my old one but the new one still in the box as a spare I also have one at my camper the reason for this. I couldn't imagine going too many days without the coffee at makes if you look around you can get the K-Cups had a good price nice thing is you're not pouring out half a pot of coffee at the end of the morning excellent productRobert lamarche
"One of the less expensive Keurig's. A bit noisy, but makes a quick, tasty cup of coffee."
I love it! It was easy to set up. It brews consistently delicious coffee every morning. I love that it makes just enough for me. .
"I purchased this item in May 2016, it is now Sept 2016 and it has stopped working. Since it is a refurbished item, the warranty does not exist. Buyer beware. It is money down a rat hole."
"This was a gift and the person using the Keurig K55 loves it, 6 months and going strong"
Excellent coffee maker at a great price. enjoying it every day.
"The K55 is sort of the low line full sized Keurig, but it does the job as well as the more expensive models.  Not much fancy chrome or digital readouts....just good coffee."
A basic unit which does the job.
I love my Keurig!! I've been iffy to buy it but in stores cost $50-$100. I liked what I paid for it and well worth it. It was very easy to set up it comes with 4 K-cups and a Wather Filter Starter Kit. I definitely recommend this to all you coffee lovers.
"Great coffee maker.  It's NOT a 2.0 Keurig, so ANY k-cups will work.  Does a very nice job brewing, and beverages come out great."
Excellent product and the price beat any I saw advertised at all the usual retail stores.  Using the k-cups cuts down on waste.
"5 months old, used approximately 5-6 times per week, broken.....leaking water everywhere.  Is it too late for a refund???? So disappointed."
FIRST ONE REPLACED SECOND ONE- YOU HAVE TO PLAY WITH TO GET A FULL CUP OF COFFEE--NOT CONSISTENT--
"This is my second Keurig, Love the coffee maker and the K cups you use with it.  I will not go back to a pot coffee maker"
Perfect. saves me tons of money i use to go and buy a energy drink every morning before work now i wake up 1 press of a button 5 min later some good caffeine pack java is waiting for me to chug!!!
Not much to say but I love my Keurig!!
Works well. Lots of junk coffees out there you have to experiment a lot to find ones you like.
Very pleased. Keurig K55 is a great coffee brewer. Would purchase again and give as a gift. Machine is wonderful. Works great.
"I bought two of these, one for me and one for my daughter, and neither one of them works correctly.  They will work a few times and then the next time they are used, they don't work!  I am so disappointed because I had a Keurig for years that worked perfectly."
So far so good. It dispenses coffee and heats up water extremely fast. Like under 2 mins. Hopefully it'll last us a long time.
Love it. Use it every day. Easy convenient and quick. Heats well. Has an on and off switch. Great product for the price.
"So far so good.  Haven't had any complaints, but has been really easy to use!  Wife was excited to have this for Christmas and we have been using this ever since.  We don't even have to go to the local coffee shops any more."
"great pot, wish the temp was adjustable though"
Very cheaply made. The water temperature is not constant. The lid will not stay up to allow insert of the K-cup. Two hand operation. I will not but again.
"Got a great price and makes a nice, hot 10 oz. cup of coffee in less than 2 minutes"
Bought for work office. Works great and everyone appreciated it. With the tank it gives you a fresh cup of coffee in about 20 seconds. Great buy for the price
"This  was a Christmas gift we gave to ourselves and we are enjoying. Works great! You have to use a large cup and a small cup to fill most coffee mugs but since the coffee pods are a little strong for us..we just use the same pod for the 2 runs and the strength is about right. I'm not a coffee fan so I like that I can do a hot cocoa, tea or a cappuccino with it."
We take this with us to the beach houseAnd love itWorks great
"We have used this 3 weeks, one cup a day, and it clogs. It is very awkward to try to open holes. Although support was helpful, Keurig needs to be improved."
My original Keurig quit pumping so I replaced it with this like model. The biggest thing I notices is the Dispenser handle seems more flimsy an will not stay fully open
"Practical and well priced, but coffee is not as hot as I like."
Filled standard cup and small mug to overflowing.  Used both Keurig K-cups as well as reusable using my own coffee.  Returned and what began as somewhat confusing (address as supplied was incorrect) was corrected quickly and efficiently by seller and purchase and postage refunded.  Thank you.  Elizabeth Whelan
"Like that it use old style pods still , use the Sanfran bay brand pods,also can use the pod more then once to get 2 cups out one pod. Cheers."
The water is not hot enough.  I thought it was suppose to be that way until I tried 3 others the same model and their water was hot hot. Is there any recourse on this product?
"Perfect.  I recommend buying the reusable pods though, as this system can create a lot of waste!"
"I love Keurigs and had our last for years. We tried to upgrade a bit to this one, and less than 2 mo in, it stopped brewing and sits there running forever and then never brewing. What a waste of money. Of course it's now after the month I purchased so I can't return it and I don't have the box anymore. I'm very unhappy AND without coffee today. ??"
Love my K55. I read a lot of reviews and looked at several models. IMO their are too many models to choose from and the difference between them is difficult to ascerta.
"got this one for a spare already have one and love it, needed one for the motor home for camping, thanks"
"Changed my coffee life, so easy. Just a bit big on the counter, but I'm adjusting because it makes my morning easy."
"This is my second Keurig I own and I bought it to use in my office. That being said, I know how the Keurig should function. The Keurig I received is faulty. It pours erratically and spills out of the cup, and sometimes it just doesn't pour at all unless I keep opening and closing the k-cup door. I just tried to replace it through Amazon and found to my dismay that I cannot do an exchange, only a refund. So return this one and re-buy it right? Wrong. I can't get it for the same price anymore. Very disappointed!!"
I've given it a couple months to change my mind but I haven't. I works when it feels like working. This morning I spent 45 minutes trying to make one cup of coffee. I love the taste of Kcup coffee but this machine is THE WORST!!
This is a wonderful coffee maker.  Just as advertised and worked out of the box.  Makes 3 different cup sizes of coffee.
"We enjoy our coffee every morning with our Keurig.  Soooo easy my husband serves serves me coffee, oatmeal, and even a scone some days to enjoy with the coffee!"
Was looking for a model with more features but this one is perfect. I agree with the other reviewers that this is the easiest to use and does everything I need.
Only problem is it doesn't fill cup up so have to restart with small cup to fill up
"This doesn't light the water resevoir like my old one so hard to tell it's out. It also seems to not hold as much water which is a bit annoying. I do like the option of auto 2 hour shut off. Would not buy this version again, but I love Keurig."
great for one cup at a time
"Purchased on May 1, 2016 and it died on October 20, 2016. The ""Add Water"" light is on all the time even though the water tank is full. I have searched the sellers and the Keurig web site to find anything on warranty repair and can't find any way to contact them."
Money well spent we love our coffee in the mornings.very easy to maintain and i dobt waste as much coffee anymore. Cant wait to upgrade.
Returned because it is too large and bulky.  I have a very small counter top area.  The Keurig K250 is much better.
"So far so good! I've used it with coffee filters, KCups, and cappuccino drinks.  Heats up pretty quickly, a little louder than expected but doesn't bother me."
"Easy to set-up, Heats water very fast for a quick cup of coffee or coco. Simple to clean. Very Happy with this buy."
"Bought this September 2016, it is now June 2017 and it stopped working.. when I plug it, it starts making a clicking sound and all lights start flashing. I bought this through Amazon and vendor is Amazon.com LLC and I cannot find any numbers or anyone I can contact to file a claim or something. This is unacceptable, never buying anything electronic from Amazon.Com LLC again"
We enjoy our Keurig K55 very much. We buy our coffee by club for 5 weeks at a time. Averages $.45 per cup.
Great tea/coffee
Keuring Machine...but it has the 'auto-off' feature lacking on most models. Makes a great office machine (reason I purchased). Water capacity is typical for this class.
Have used it every day since it arrived.  Experimenting with different flavors of coffee. Best price from Amazon.
"We are very pleased with our Keurig. Originally purchased for my husband as a Christmas present, I find I use it as well."
"We love the K-cup coffee makers, wouldn't use anything else."
"I  had the original Keurig for many, many years but sadly, it died and I ordered a new one .. Keurig 55. It is fabulous!  It's quiet, coffee is piping hot, and I just love it.  I loved my old one, also, but this one is tons better.  Thank you!"
Great for the office.
Works great. First unit was DOA but it might have been a shipping issue. Amazon was great as always and sent a new one right out. I love the taste of a fresh cup all the time.
This unit has issues..first time we used it the water spilled out from k cup area instead of where it should come from. We may end up sending this unit back..we had a previous keurig and were very happy with it.
Pump never worked right out of the box and the needle kept getting clogged. Had an original one of these for 3 years and it worked great. New ones have a much cheaper feel and obviously don't work as well.
This Keurig Classic uses any K-Cup which is what we wanted.  A good product that arrived quickly and in good shape.  Very happy!
I got this for my mom as a replacement to her old machine. It came quickly and looks great.
"Excellent machine for that quick cup of coffee.  Eliminates the coffee pot set up and clean up and leftover brew going to waste.  This is NOT a commercial machine and, if used daily, you should only expect two years+ usage before having to repair or replace."
Love this coffee maker. Takes Keurig or genetic kcups. Great coffee maker at a good price with fast shipping.
The quality of the K55 did not meet the quality of the Keurig coffee maker that I bought several years ago. The construction materials were much flimsier and the response time after selecting the cup size was much slower.
"I am returning my second one of this model.  As with the first, it brewed two cups and then stopped working.  I am hoping Amazon is as great about my second return as they were about the first, but this time I will not be ordering the same model!"
"Bought this in May, 2016 and is now broken. Water reservoir sensor doesn't work and the water won't heat up. Very disappointed. Will attempt to return via manufacturer's website."
I am not a coffee drinker .. my husband is .. he doesn't think it works as well as our previous one. All he said is it just doesn't seem to work correctly.
"Our kids enjoy the single cup coffee, they got these for Christmas and thanked us and said they are great."
"This is a replacement for my  ""worn out"" keurig. It's fine, except the water reservoir is smaller than my other one, so it seems I'm always filling it."
I replaced an older model and am very satisfied.  It seems to take a bit longer than I recalled but the coffee is very good.
This is great! A quick fresh cup of coffee available all the time. I love it.
"We have had this model Keurig before and it worked great for about a year and a half..  We got this one to replace our old one.  Unfortunately, after making about 20 cups of coffee it started malfunctioning and we are returning it.  Hassle :("
"Functionally, it works. It makes some of the weakest coffee I've had in my life. I had a Keurig mini before this for a couple years before it stopped turning on. I bought this as a replacement, and I've been incredibly unimpressed. Even on the 6oz setting, the coffee is undrinkably weak. The water shoots through it at such a break-neck pace that it doesn't have time to pick up any flavor. I thought it might be the unit I had so I got a replacement but it's just oh so slightly better. This thing will brew a 10oz cup of coffee (from the start of dispensing until it's done) in just over 30 seconds. It needs to dispense the water at a slower rate if it's going to pick of any of the flavor from the grounds on the way through. I'm going to return mine and either get a 2.0 that has the brew strength option, or figure out an easy alternative to owning a Keurig."
"A gift for my daughter, I was happy to buy it for her so I'll give it 5 stars. Hope it works & hope she like."
I bought this for my fiance and she has told me several times that it make the perfect cup of coffee. She loves it.
I have had both this Keurig and the Keurig 2.0 and I can honestly say that they are very compatible.
Not a great unit it's slow and just isn't very good takes forever to heat up and I leave it on. I have to push the button twice for a cup of coffee and it never fills my cup even on the highest setting. Would not recommend
Works just fine.  I also bought the attachment so you can use your own ground coffee instead of the pods.  A good investment.
Great!  We drink different types of coffee and this makes life very easy each morning.  I highly recommend!
we bought this for are daughter who is in the military had it shipped to her new place used it for one month and quit working never again will I by this to late to send they say
"Like other Keurig coffeemakers, the model K55 makes a quick cup of great-tasting coffee.  It's a bit louder than other models I've used, but for the price it can't be beat."
Bought to replace my 6 year old keurig. I love the features on this one
"Wouldn't be without my Keurig! When my old one died, I immediately got this new one! They're GREAT!"
"I should start by saying that I am NOT a coffee drinker.  Never have been, never will be.  But I work for a small office (4 of us total) and only one drinks coffee. Occasionally, we have potential customers come in and it's nice to be able to offer them coffee.  We started with a standard Mr. Coffee type coffee maker.  But the one individual who does drink coffee kept breaking the glass carafe.  So we moved on to a small, metal machine.  That only made about 1.5 cups at a time which wasn't efficient if we had more than one visitor.  The powers that be finally decided to splurge on a Keurig.  The coffee drinker was tagged to make the decision on which of the multitude of functions we needed.  We decided on this particular machine based on capacity, price and ease of use.When first ordered, I was given a delivery date weeks in the future.  Within 24 hours, that was changed to about 5 days.  It arrived on this second specified date.  It was well packaged to protect all the plastic and metal parts.  Came with detailed instructions that even a non-coffee drinker like myself could understand.  The filter was packaged separately and the directions did not specify when this should be inserted so I did this when someone else noticed it was missing.So it was easy to set up and even easier to use.  It arrived with a 4 pack of sample pods.  Since this is for the business use, I registered my Keurig on their website.  When I did this, I received a code to get 50% off my first order of pods (with a few exclusions).  So I ordered a box of coffee and a box of tea.  These both arrived within the next week.The water reservoir holds a lot of water and the auto shut off feature is a plus!I would recommend this as it's easy to set up, easy to use and easy to clean.  It's lightweight so you don't have to lug heavy pieces around."
"My original Keurig single-serve coffeemaker finally died after years of hard use, and after reading the reviews this model seemed closest to what I needed. (The extra bells & whistles of the 2nd generation style machines didn't seem worth the extra cost.) My K55 is used daily, usually 2-3 times a day, and on a few occasions has been used almost nonstop for nearly an hour with guests in the hose -- with nary a glitch. Although it has its own repertoire of pumping & gurgling sounds, it's actually a bit quieter than the old coffeemaker and has NONE of the loud vibration-induced buzzes & rattles that shake my parents' kitchen when they use their larger (older) coffeemaker.My only real complaint is that the only auto-off option is a two-hour delay; since this is a single-serve machine I would've preferred a 20-30 minute timer instead. Still, it takes no real effort to just hit the power button when I'm done using it.I don't expect this unit to break for a long, long time -- but if it does, I'll definitely buy another!"
"Old one died after 7 years. K55 is most similar to the model I had previously. New one performs admirably. If i were to nitpick, I would complain about the mechanical noises during cold start warmup and post brewing. Otherwise meets and exceeds expectations."
it is now a better day for my family and co-workers with my new Keurig!
"It seems like a good machine so far. My previous machine had already started giving me trouble by this time. It's made less than 60 cups and I had to ""unclog"" the needle already but there was nothing there. Do all machines sound like fog horns when they finish brewing? I like having my first cup of coffee right away and I have my own K-Pods to refill with coffee or loose tea."
The water reservoir is a little too small making you fill it too often but other than that it works as described.
It's a backup because the original is old.  The pump gets weak after a while.
Wish I had purchased a long time ago.
Coffee maker broke after a few uses. Keurig is not exactly a consumer friendly company. We tossed it and bought a Mr. Coffee k cup. Much better.
I brought this item only 4 months ago and it has stopped working already and there is no way or option to have if returned of fixed it obviously has a defect to stop working this early after purchasing
Does its job for a two person house hold or single person.  Got for my single daughter.
"Item as described, Prompt Shipment"
another great gift for my daughter...she can use this to have soup and ramen noodle cups...a wise investment
Not one problem what so ever. Other more expensive models have given me issues.
I should have gotten one years ago. Perfect for a quick cup of coffee.
"I love it, I am not a big coffee drinker so the single serve works just right for me. the selection of different coffees, hot chocolate and hot apple cider are great"
Good buy. I don't drink a lot of coffee so this is so perfect for me
"I'm in love with my Keurig. It's absolutely perfect for me and brews in either a 6 oz., 8 oz., or 10 oz. It's perfect for my iced coffee in the morning!"
"The ONLY thing wrong with the coffee maker is it's power down mode to save money. I have to wait an extra 2 minutes in the morning for my first cup, otherwise, it has performed perfectly every time."
"Makes hubby happy, and daughter too, since he is not using her Keurig now."
"I have only had this for 2 months and i love it, I researched all Keurigs and picked the perfect one for me, I wanted something versitile and inexpensive (compared to the other ones) The newer version (not the k55)only allows the K cup brand pods ( which almost all Kpods are now). WITH THIS ONE YOU CAN USE AN KIND OF KCUPS (not only Keurig)"
"First Keurig, and, all in all, I like it.  What I don't like is that the largest cup it will make is only 10.5 ounces -- enough to fill a standard, restaurant-size coffee cup.  Needs greater capacity -- I like my coffee by the mug."
It is a little different than my previous Keurig.  Still makes a great cup of coffee. Wish that the water resoviuer  was easier to access.  Cover is akward.
"I'm recently widowed and only drink one cup of coffee in the morning, so I really enjoy that I can have my morning coffee so easy & quick. Works perfectly. I also got in on a good sale, which made buying this Keurig that much more attractive."
"Very easy to set up and use, love the coffee coming out really hot. I would recommend this coffee maker."
"Christmas gift, have not heard how it is working.  No news is good news I guess."
This is my second Keurig K-Cup machine and BOTH BROKE. I've only had this one for six months and it works like crap. Now it barely brews a cup. You have to run it twice just to fill up a mug and it takes about three minutes to do it each time. Garbage.
Great price.  Just what I needed.
Have owned several Keurig machines. This one was purchased for our camper.  Excellent product.
Got it for a family member for Christmas. Very easy to use and hasn't clogged like the other did.
Best purchase ever! So easy to use and clean. I won't ever buy a regular coffee maker again.
"Love this brewer the only complaint I have is that when the water reservoir is low, it leaves about an inch of water at the bottom and then stops brewing and needs to be refilled. I seems like wasted space to me but is probably done for a reason."
Great except it doesn't work well right away when you remove the water tank and refill it.
"This is the first time we bought one of these Keurigs for ourselves.  We are very happy with it.  It works great!  We are now wondering, what took us so long to purchase a Keurig?"
This is a great coffee machine.  I only wish it had a larger water reservoir.  It performs perfectly!
eh
Item arrived in a timely manner as described.  Would use again.  Great price
I have wanted one of these for a long time! This one had the best price and love it's new features.
"Okay, I'm giving this one more try.  I had two previous models, the B50 and the K40 Elite.  Both lasted for a bout four years before irreparable failures developed.  It is rather well known that there are flaws in the design of the original series of Keurigs.  This is one of the newer models for Series 1.  The filter at the bottom of the storage tank has been beefed up, and the system now includes a charcoal water filtration system you can install into the tank.  The pump is much quieter than older models.  On the downside, the handle that closes the K-Cup holder is made of plastic instead of metal, and I feel like I'm going to break the handle off every time I make a cup of tea."
I love it mostly because u can use other pods other that Keurig
"Very dissatisfied, I am sorry to negatively report. But it stopped working 3 weeks after she opened her gift (Christmas). At 87; she was THRILLED  with the ease of one cup at s time. By the time she let me know it wasn't working, and I you tube'd for advice...the window for returns had closed. I am disappointed. I just wanted an exchange, dice she loved it, not a refund."
"Works just fine, this is my second Keurig and this model works perfectly for me."
Great coffee maker!  Bought for office because I have one at home that I love.
"Good price on this product.  Works well. I do not use K cups regularly, but got this for a brunch and it was perfect because everyone made their own coffee."
"This unit gets a workout in my house, with 4 coffee drinkers churning out cups every morning and night.  Solid."
"I love these coffee makers. My husband and I only drink 1 or 2 cups in the mornings & at different times, so it's perfect to only brew 1 cup at a time.  I gave my old one to my son, who just moved into his first apartment."
"Heats up nice and fast,  and brews quickly. Wish i bought it sooner!!"
Love it. Have been using it for about a year without any complaints.
"Was delivered to me in April and now July 1, already broken.  It's a piece of garbage. Makes about 2 ""large"" cups at a time and they are pretty small cups. Spend the money and get a big and better Keurig or just go with another brand. Don't waste your money."
I love it. It is so convenient and fast. It is also nice not to have to deal with cleaning filters or emptying wet coffee grounds.It's also nice looking.
My dad loved it as a gift because its fast and reliable
Small capacity .. 8 oz. I should have known better. It's our first so we just have to suck it up. Sigh ...
"Very good product enjoying my Coffee, very easy to put together."
"We've had ours for less than a year and it is getting loud and leaking water.  I fear it will not last much longer.  Since on most days we only brew one or two cups of coffee in it, the performance is unsatisfactory."
"all kinds of liking it here, makes great coffee, tea, oh and hot cocoa oh man."
It replaced our original Keurig when it died on us.  This coffee pot does its job very well.
I don't know what to say. Couldn't be happier! Shipped securely and fast! Thanks so much! Cant believe i got such a good deal on this!
A part from one cup per every pod..it's fabulous.love every cup.
Dad loved his Christmas present! Dad is a big fan of Keurig and was extremely pleased with the K55.
Only have had in use since the week after Christmas and it's already not working. Heats consistently and won't brew! Of course this happened right after the return window and there is no option to contact seller. :( Very disappointed.
Just had to get used to doing it 1 cup at a time.  It the only way I can get the strong taste of coffee that I love to drink.
Revolutionized breakfast. A joy to use. Easy enough for my husband to manage -- letting me sleep a bit longer. Huge choice of flavors available.
Kitchen)Worked great for the first month or so and now coffee is weak and not as hot as it should be. Tried cleaning it as instructed but still the same. Can't return it now it's 12 days past the return window. Would not buy again or recommend.
"This is my fourth keurig that I have purchased over the years. First off programmable is a bit misleading, the only thing you can program  is the shut off time. Should have paid more attention when I ordered the unit. Secondly the unit is extremely noisy when pumping water and during the brew cycle. If this is normal operation I would not recommend this unit."
How did we ever live without it? Never going back to a drip pot.
"Just what I wanted, a no frills one shot Keurig with a reservoir - which spoiled me and now I'd like an even larger reservoir I drink so much coffee."
I'm so happy - I had one of the original ones and it was so noisy - this one is quicker and MUCH quieter
"Stopped,working after four months."
Was lucky enough to catch the K55 on sale.  I had refused to buy another Keurig that set up to use special cups.  This one is not and it is amazing!
Requires cleaning after every cup of hot chocolate.  Single cup unit heated hotter and required much less space
Died at two years but we made six to eight cups a day and live in South Texas so...
Good quality
Could not do without my keurig.  Really fast and love the various sizes.  Good cup of coffee or coco
Purchased as a gift for my boyfriend. He uses it every morning to brew coffee before work. He loves the ability to switch up his coffee by day using different k cups. It's easy to use and he doesn't have to refill the water reservoir until after a few uses. I have the single cup brewer and I'm jealous of this one!
"We have had problems and have had to call to get help. We owned a Keurig before, had it close to 5 yrs. never had any issues with it. It started leaking water from the reservoir so we replaced it. This one won't do anything except sit there and click, my husband has to take it apart and clean the filter. This becomes a pain."
"I received this coffee maker, ran the first mug of water through to clean it out and then the whole system shut off and won't turn back on again.I called Keurig and they don't have a solution, this product is supposed to be new and it won't even turn on. Luckily, Keurig are offering me a replacement."
i love this coffee maker!! Easy to set up and use. I also like the many options of coffee and other beverages that can be purchased.
Already malfunctioning.  Last one also.  Not sure whether it is worth the hassle.
"It's so nice making only one cup of coffee. No more wasting half a pot. Price was very good, to the point that if you have been waiting to buy one now is the time."
"I bought this as a gift for one of my sisters.  She loves it, says it works great."
"makes a good cup of coffee, make it strong or weaker as you like it"
Love it!! Me and my husband don't drink coffee but this is perfect for when we have visitors. We bought a variety pack of the little coffee's so they can pick what they want.
"this is the biggest piece of junk that I have purchased in a long, long while.  I was give ,as a gift ,a Keurig K55 coffee maker. It worked for 3 months and then just refused to produce a cup of coffee. I junked that one only to buy another and this piece of junk was worse the the first.  I am very, very unhappy with this product and they should never sell anything like this."
I really like Keurig coffee makers. This one will make about 4 cups before adding water
This coffee maker is amazing and I would recommend it to everyone.  It was affordable and convenient for my entire family.
Working so far (just received it). This the third and final Keurig. They never last more than a year. Probably need to stop drinking coffee.
Was purchased as a house warming gift. My girl loves it. Fast shipment & good price
we enjoy this Coffee maker very much! The coffee is right temperature...
Love the machine but it's $15 cheaper at Walmart everybody! I wish I would have known before I overpaid
"Great cup of coffee without all of the buttons & settings. Insert pod, push button.....great for elderly father."
"Oh boy, does my spouse love this machine."
"Love my Keurig!! ...I say this every morning, while making coffee in my Keurig :)Got rid of my Ninja coffee maker the moment my Keurig arrived and never looked back  This coffee machine is better than sliced bread!"
I can make a cup of coffee or tea without much fuss.  Enjoy having a variety of coffee handy.  I don't have all those coffee grounds and filters that don't work properly.  No mess when making a beverage with the pods.
Stopped working after a few months
"Used less than 10 times and it's not working! Great, more junk for my money! Oh, it's past the 30 day return window. Can't return the JUNK!"
"Keeps breaking for one reason or another.  First one was sent back, but the second one often dies to work."
"I love our Kureg. It works well, is quick and easy on busy mornings."
Bought in late Dec. And already does not give full cup of coffee.  Even though we used bottled water... very disappointrd
Works great! Bought this for my office! Simple to use and it heats up quickly.
My wife has been using this since we got it and loves it. She's had no problems with it at all.
"I set this up, used it for a day, and then it stopped sucking water from the reservoir.  I changed the filter, but that didn't do anything.  I called Keurig support and they walked me through some steps so that I got it to work for two more cups, then it stopped working again.  So I returned it.  Won't buy again."
"We are not coffee drinkinger, but we are really loving it."
"Keurig rules.  My parents have one and I bought my own.  No more wasted coffee and plenty of variety of coffees, teas, hot cocoa to please guests."
great Keurig for the house bought it as a gift and my parents love how simple it is!
"Is this a good coffee maker: no.  It's k cups so you have to take that for what it is.  It's supposed to be Convenient.  Coffee has come down so much but K cups, per cup, remain VERY high.  The Green Mtn (Keurig's K Cup Brand) Coffee Fair Trade Organic Sumatran Reserve, K-Cup is the only one out of dozens I tried that tastes like something you'd get at a good upscale coffee house (thus the 2 stars).  Now it loses one star because this is not how you brew coffee.  The coffee never blooms, the water just passes though the grounds and into your cup.  Also, the average temperature temperature out of the needle (that flows into your K cup) is about 175F.  That's horrible!  Coffee should be brewed between 195F and 205F, nothing less, nothing more.  When you go higher you get burnt coffee (think of starbucks all the time).  When you go lower like the Keurig here you get sour coffee.  The Sumatran Reserve is the only exception which seems to tolerate both the terrible brew cycle and the under temperature water.  So lose another star for water temperature.So I said before, your giving up great coffee at a higher price per cup and convenience of a single cup when you want it. But my Keurig (your mileage will vary) had the top needle clogged within a week.  Really?  So I wasted two K cups trying to figure out what was wrong.  A paper clip and a flashlight and I had it cleaned again.  Convenience, no, no, I think not?  - 1 star.Bottom line (TL;DR).  Get a real coffee maker, one that guarantees brewing temps between 195F and 205F.  Don't fall for for the easy trap.  These people don't care about good coffee, and if you do, you won't buy a K Kup machine."
Works just fine.  Was a replacement for one we lost in a flood.
This is one of the best purchases I have made in a long time!
Purchased for my mom as a Christmas gift. She is elderly but easily able to operate this unit. It is a great buy.
"So far we are liking this.  Our old one was making a lot of noise,  but we wanted to stay with a fairly basic model.  This suits!!  Makes 3 sizes of cups."
Love my Keurig and my coffee.  Goes great with my Contigo mugs
Great Buy.. machine is not too loud and makes life much easier as a college student .. WE NEED OUR COFFEE !!!
Great machine and makes a very good cup of coffee every time.
The best coffee maker !!
"Great.  Pods are way expensive.  Not sure the reusable pods that you fill with coffee yourself will work with the machine.  The coffee is either too strong or too weak depending on which of the 3 cup sizes you choose.  If you like strong coffee in a large mug, you have to use 2 pods on the small cup setting.  Really handy though."
This makes a great cup of coffee.  I used the cups twice.  I prefer a weaker cup of coffee.
The machine broke in just a few months. This is not worth the money.
Purchased this as a Christmas gift for a family and the all love it!!!! It is perfect.
Never worked. Past time to return. Waste of money and time. Should have listened to reviews!
I love it. Works great and does exactly what it is supposed to do.
Works well and easy to use.  Good streamlined style also so it doesn't take up too much counter space.
This Keurig is not even a year old and it quit.  I only use it to make 2 cups per day.  So disappointed!
I had this less than 2 months and it stopped working. I used filter water and had a charcoal filter in the machine. It simply stopped up and wouldn't bring any water thru the system. It just makes a lot of noise and nothing happens. 80 bucks wasted. That is a lot for a few cups of coffee.
"I love this K55 so much I bought 2 of them, one for my vacation home."
"I've had this model before(from Costco) and thought I just got a bad machine. I bought it again from amazon and sure enough, the motor quit. Try a different model, this one is unreliable."
works perfects and a great price.  Free shipping if you have prime makes it the best price around.
A simple Keurig machine with ease of use.  It is perfect for our small office.
Items works great.  Makes a nice cup in the morning and saves me the time stopping at DD.
"Works great! Love it. Would recommend to anyone. Easy to set up and use. Sort of like Energizer bunny, just keeps making coffee again and again!"
Got this for my sister for Christmas. She was thrilled and seems to love it!
Got this as a Christmas present and they absolutely loves it. Hasn't had any issues and they use it all of the time
Bought this model instead of the newer ones. Can use any pod and no possibility of failure of screen. Makes a good cup of coffee.
My new Keurig was easy to set up and works exactly as expected.It is nice having the water hot and waiting for me to use instead of having to fill it before each cup.
"I returned my first machine that was received completely defective. Amazon was very quick to send a replacement which works great. The only complaint is that this model is very loud and noisey when brewing! I wasn't use to this at first, but now it doesn't bother me."
I bought this machine for a dear friend. She loves it. I had one like it for four years with out any problem.
Had the coffee pot less than 2 months and it already quit working.
Does not coffee very hot.
"Serves my needs nicely, does a good job of brewing and it was a good price."
I really like it.  I bought it for my office and I like the fact that it has a water reservior so I don't have to constantly fill it up.
Water resevoir is on the small side and there is more plastic than I thought. No way close to Cuisinart.
I WAS USING A COFFEE PRESS - WHAT A DIFFERENCE THIS MAKES !  SO GLAD I HAVE IT
Works as described.  Wished it had a bigger tank but all I really need is the coffee
ok
This Keurig was purchased to replace one. I love the three cup sizes that can be used.
"Didn't live up to all the hype, only had this Keurig for a month as it was a Christmas gift and it stopped working. When it worked it was great but given the amount of money for these Keurigs i expected better. Very disappointed ?? my Mr Coffee maker lasted 2yrs."
I love it. Very reliable. Makes great coffee in a hurry. What more could you ask for
Returned.  My daughter gave me one as a present
after the 4th one i buy this is the only that has worked until now.
pump sometimes fails to provide a full cup.
So convenient when you have company and need to make multiple cups at once!
kids and family love it. gets them to drink tea instead of soda and juices.
Third one I have owned. Works well for me. Last three to four years before problems develope
Omg!!! This one quit working also. The first One was not pumping wAter and now the replacement is doing the same!!!  Don't BUY anyone!!!!! Warning!!!!
This was purchased to donate
"I read all the reviews and thought those that had issues has to be a fluke because Keurig makes such a good product. NOT THIS MODEL! I have had two and both just stopped working after about 5 cups. Keurig customer service replaced my first on with the same model and the exact issues happened. Two in the past two months are in the trash. Even though Keurig sent me a replacement pretty easily, its is not worth the chance.  Buy a different model."
Stopped working after 6 months
The best Keurig! Easy-sneezy. Reservoir lets the guys grab a cup and get back to work!  Easy and reliable. Love it.
I gave this to my daughter & son in law as a Christmas gift.  They like it.
This coupled with a couple hits of expesso from my nespresso has become my daily caffine fix!!
Excellent coffee maker. Quick convenient and efficient.
"This was shipped in just one day, just in time for Christmas. My husband loves it and even though I don't drink coffee as much as I used to, it's so easy to brew a cup, without the hassle of cleaning the larger pot every day. It's more expensive for the coffee k-cups, but offers us and guests the convenience of what type to brew (dark, mild, flavored, etc). We love it!"
"This is a gift for someone, I am sure they will be happy with it. I liked it myself.."
This is a good machine I use it everyday so far it is working well.
happy except the coffee doesn't really get hot
Worked a few times but now wont work at all.  Missed the return date by 5 days so I huess it's like throwing $100.00 in the garage.  Thanks for nothing
Could only use machine a few times without it not pushing water through properly. I do like how hot the coffee gets! I had the K15 and it never had the problems that we have with this one. Wouldn't recommend.
Bought these for my children... they work great... would like one size larger in serving.
Love it! I got this model for Christmas and even though my boyfriend was skeptical about replacing our regular coffee pot he is now a keurig fan. We love the options it gives each of us for having the perfect coffee.
Didn't last 24 hours; sent it back.  My last Keurig lasted two years and 8 months; died without warning.  Won't buy another Keurig
Typical Keurig ; works when it wants to
Our former Keurig went kaput. We could hardly wait for this one to arrive.
"this product only worked for 4 days and quit. I bought another Keurig K55 locally, and it lasted 3 days before it failed also.Would not recommend buying this model to anyone."
Very pleased with my new Keurig.  This is my second one. Thanks for a great product.
Absolutely love it! Makes great coffee and tee so fast. Great help anytime!
This model used the original pods and brews very good coffee that we expect from Keurig.
"Use this all day, everyday.  Works great."
Best and easiest to use coffee maker I have owned.Am completely happy with it.
Bought it for my husband. He loves it!
She uses it every morning to make any coffee she feels like drinking that day
"Had the Keurig K55 for 39 days, and it's already clogging and having issues brewing a cup. I understand how to clean the machine, but having to clean it monthly is a bit disappointing."
Our beloved original Keurig finally died and we ordered a replacement. Keurig has changed the model features. The cup size options do not fit any of our coffee cups correctly. The small is really for a espresso size and the medium spills over our regular diner size cups. The water canister is awkward to hold and difficult to set into the proper spot. Maybe ours is defective (I am returning it) but half the time we wake up to find water has leaked out onto the counter.
"First of all, good morning. I have been using coffee makers for 20 years now and this specific classic keurig k55 has been very effective. the temperature of the coffee produced is just the perfect heat needed for the perfect morning, afternoon, cup of coffee. if you treat your machine with love trust me, its going to last."
"Works well, not too large on the counter"
Wish it dispensed larger amounts of coffee for my mugs but it is a good machine.
Convenient and non-messy
This was a gift to my sister.  Her last one lasted years and took a dump as soon as we arrived for a visit.  She loves hers.
Very nice product.  Love the convenience.
Think this is a knock off item.It does not always work properly or give the correct amount of coffee selected.
"Perfect for my shared workspace. Budget-friendly, easy to fill, clean, and easy for all users to work. Also love the 6-, 8-, and 10- ounce options for filling."
4th one I've given as a present.  Guess I like it
My first Keurig was purchased 03/2009 - here's hoping this one gives me as good of a run!so far I love it!
"I bought this as a gift for my sister, it was incredibly priced during the Black Friday/cyber Monday weekend. It gets the job done and is easy to use."
Coffee every day at the push of a button. What more could you ask for?
Great machine. If you like coffee you'll love this Keurig
"The best, works right out of box, great buy."
Spent $100 on this thing and it crapped out 15 months later. I will not spend one more cent on any Keurig products.
My daughter just loves her Christmas gift!  Pods do get pricey.
This were perfect and the quality was excellent.
"Keurig makes a good product.  I have not had to use it yet so it is still in the box.  10 year old model was having problems so I purchased this one.  Before it arrived, she thumped the bottom of the old one and it has now been working fine for several months.  What can I say.  The new one will be ready when needed."
This is a replacement for my old Keurig which lasted 5 years.
This is the best coffee maker I have ever own.
do not let filter dry out  will not work if you do  you can just remove or re soak it
Replacement for the same model we  used for many years. Still works great!
this machine is a little louder then my old one but it still makes great coffee
"We had  the smaller Keurig ,  just couldn't keep up with what we needed.  This works wonderfully."
It does NOT work well.....has to be unpluged occassionally to reprogram & then wait about 5 minutes to reprogram. The one I had was 6 years old and finally wore out. This one is cheaply made!!!! Will buy my next one from Kohls where they agreeably accept returns without having to repackage and mail!!!
Loving my new one!  Wish the old one still worked but hopefully with the new filter in this system it will last longer.
"I am sure the Keurig if would have been fine. Unfortunately it was damaged beyond use when my mother set the box it came in on the stove, accidentally turning on a burner and setting the box on fire. We managed to get the burning box out of the house and she extinguished the fire without damaging the house but the keurig was toast."
"I like the fast cup of coffee, but i don't like the coffee grinds in the cup.  I am not pleased with this product."
Made my daughter's Christmas.  She loves this.
Love this model. Highly recommend.
"Nice! Working fast, boiling water good - makes coffee as expected. Not expensive. Recommend!"
Water pump broke after a month
Absolutely love it. It was a gift for my grandma and she just raves over it. Tells everyone she can Lol. It works great and fast if you have company over. Would definitely recommend it's a great buy.
Was purchased as a gift to replace a broken Keurig. New machine brews faster than the broken one used to.
Bought this as a gift and she loved it works great.
Purchased this for my office at work - so far so good and hoping it lasts a while.  Arrived perfect and packaged well!
"Christmas present for my mom. She absolutely loves it and yeah it's pretty cool and neat. Easy to clean, looks nice, good drinks, and fun."
Love this. I'm so glad I bought one. I toiled over it and I don't regret it.
I like the machine but the coffee is not hot enough
Very nice unit at a great price
I have been wanting one for over a year and I am thrilled to death.
"This is one versatile machine, and it takes/makes Peet's Major Dickerson blend coffee."
"Fast shipping, great packaging, couldn't be better. Thank you!"
Quit working about 40 days after the return date closed-I'm going back to my French press!
This is the third Keurig Coffee Maker I've purchased (2 K55s). I really like them!
So far very good.  My last Keurig stopped up often and only made a 1/2 cup.
My first Keurig I love it the price was reasonable
"Completely satisfied. like the additional descaling indicator light. This is my second Keurig brewer, first one lasted five plus years of daily usage.  Will gladly purchase another when, if this one requires replacement after Five years"
Came with four samplers which is wonderful. Also purchase with coffee variety sampler of 40. Easy to set up so far no issues
This is the second machine I've bought where first it had a terrible smell and then the motor went out. This one is only 2 months old. Very disappointing. Used to be such s good product.
"This package did not include the K-Pod for ground coffee. This problem was solved with a phone call to Keurig that was answered by Jalana, a very helpful employee. She ordered a replacement part for me during my conversation with her and registered my machine at the same time. This is my second machine and I am very happy with it."
"This would be great if it brewed a whole cup, even on large it is ridiculously small"
Works but cheaply made. Plastic is thin.Hope it lasts.I miss my older model Cuisinart.
Bought this Keuring on April 20.  June 20 it won't make coffee.  It's completely broken.
Works great. Makes alot of noise and does not hold alot of water
Great productGreat price
works great. replaced one we wore out.
"Nice, a bit better than the previous model."
Great product. Good quality. Best money ever spent. Love it.
It seems okay. At least once a week I have to shove a paperclip into one of the prongs to clear a blockage.
I love this Keurig. No issues so far and it is so easy to use.
Love it. this is the second one and purchased for a family member
bought to replace my old one.  I love Keurigs!
"Unit was easy to set up, and now am enjoying coffee or tea by the cup, when I want it."
"Bought this for my husband for work.  We have one at home, we love both of them.  They are great and user friendly."
I use the fill-your-own pods.  Works great.
seems to not have an Auto-Off timer
"It works as intended but it pulls so much power (15 amps) that it blows a breaker if I have anything else going at the same time like a toaster, griddle or blender!"
Very easy  and convenient.
the only thing i didn't like about my keurig machine is that sometimes the machine throws in some extra water and make the coffee a little bit less strong. not a huge difference but for me it is because for my work a need very strong coffee. my rating would be 8/10 it is a very good investment
Great coffee maker!!We love ours!!Has 3 cup sizes
This is an excellent coffee maker. I really use the heck out of it. Never fails to brew a great cup of coffee. I use one at home and one at work. Thanks guys.
Only use this about ten times a day. Enough said.
Using this for a few months now in the conference room! No issues :) Happy sippers!
"I purchased this product May 19, 2017 and received it on May 24, 2017. Within a week of having my Keurig it started making this obnoxious clicking sound randomly and half the time it does not want to turn on. I have not gotten to use it that much. Could someone please contact me."
"We have had this for less than 6 months & it stopped working. When you push the button for a large, it brews less than a small cup and it's lukewarm at best. We replace the filters on time and only use bottled water in it."
"Had one before, this is replacement and it does the job."
"Do NOT buy this coffee maker!Mine was fine, then suddenly it stopped working one morning about 1 month after I purchased it.  Now it just makes a lot of gurgling noises, but no coffee.  I tried all the obvious things but I do not plan to take this thing apart.I pulled out my old Mr. Coffee that is still good after all these years."
Works well and is sturdy. Gives good coffee each time.
"Bought this to replace my old Mr Coffee brewer, and I really like this model.  Being able to choose size/strength is wonderful!"
"No complaints. Performed as advertised. Convenient, fun to use."
Good machine and good price
Fast brewing and easy water refill.
"It's a Keurig and it works great for my new office. :) As long as it continues to brew, I will never stew. LOL"
"this is one of the best products I have ever bought, quick, easy, love it."
"This was my third Keurig, the past two proved to be much more reliable.  After only two months of use it broke, and now all it does is flash that it needs water and is heating.  I am very disappointed in my purchase.  As a result of this machine's failure, I will have to reconsider my use of single cup brewers going forward.  Avoid this product, or you will be coffeeless in a couple months too."
the jury is still out on this one.  I'm not sure that the expense of this maker is worth it.
Product shipped was what I wanted and it was delivered in a timely manner
does not make coffee hot. Always have to microwave it after brewing coffee.
Bought this Keurig for a deployed location and stopped working about two months of use.  Water will not pour out (And we use only bottled water) so says to descale it.  Now it just sits.  No descaler and no vinegar.
Bought it for my nephew's college dorm room.  Perfect convenience.
The best!! Bought it for a friend and her kids!  She's over the Moon!!
Grandma loves it. We got the drawer storage for k cups too
"Keuirg works perfect, coffee is hot, haven't had any problems, easy setup, clear instructions, would recommend it to anybody that asks about purchasing a keuirg"
"The largest size, not enough..Large and small overflow. Medium and small, pour a little out to make room for milk."
Ordered this for my grandmother. Just like mine. She loves it!
"I purchased this Keurig in September of 2016, and in less than 6 months, does not work properly.  I tried to get it replaced, and was told it is not returnable or replaceable"
Works great and was so easy to set up. Doesn't fit all travel mugs with the removable drip tray.
I love Keurig coffee machines.  This one is just as expected.
"I've literally only had this Keurig one day. I took this thing out of its box around the same time yesterday, only to be packing it up to return it today. How severely disappointing!It was working this morning, but when I came home for lunch, the machine wouldn't suck up more than 1/2 cup of water from the reservoir. It would act like it was trying to brew. I heard the machine heating up, but when it went to spit out the coffee, it made a strange clicking sound, and after several seconds of doing that, it decided it was done and didn't brew anything.I unplugged, plugged back in, reseated the water reservoir, went through all of the troubleshooting steps, to no avail. This Keurig is dead, and on only the second day of use. Horrible, horrible, horrible quality! Will never buy a Keurig product again. I spent way too much money on a piece of garbage.Get your act together, Keurig. I expected much better than this."
"Needed to replace my Keurig that died, and I just wanted the exact same. Thought this was it, but it doesn't have the clock with the auto-start option."
"delivered, unopened and on time  >its great for coffee but ants in the water.. not many not big but every day 3-5.other than that I love it.."
I LOVE this K55 Keurig Coffe Maker!!!! I have used it for about 3 months now. It works perfect and is so much easier and quicker than my regular pot coffee maker! I am still experimenting to find which kcup flavors I like best. I am having so much fun with it. I originally hesitated because it is one of the cheaper models but have had no problems wit it yet!
"this machine is quite nice! it is very solid, and makes a quick, good cup."
Didn't need the fancy touchscreen of the newer Keurig just need it to make coffee which it does well.
"My husband and I have thoroughly enjoyed our new Keurig coffee maker...when our friends come over we always invite them to have a cup of coffee that only takes seconds to make...we love it, love it, love it."
Love Love LOVE LOVE my ne Keurig!!!!
"Water sometimes splashes from the top of the Keurig cup, leaking from the top and falling outside of my coffee mug."
My daughter requested this for a gift and she and her family love it!
Love Kurig. This is a great basic coffee maker. Happy happy
Works great. Purchased this for my office. 6 people use it about 25 times a day. No problems.
I should have switched a long time ago.
Stopped  working after less than 9 months.  We did not use the Kuerig on a regular basis  so I was very upset that it did not last.  It stopped pumping water.  We have cleaned several times to no avail.  This is a lot of money to waste.  I would not recommend.
"It got me drinking coffee, hot chocolate and tea again"
"It took a long time to decide to get a Keurig.  There were so many different machines, two different ""versions"", which made it difficult to choose.I finally got the machine (which I ordered with two different sets of coffee pods.  The coffee was brilliant from the very first.  (ok, not a real fan of the flavored coffees, but the dark roast types all seem excellent)Then, a miracle happened.  I registered my machine with Keurig, and they made an offer for a large percentage off on up to 5 sets of 24 pods.  I got a number of more traditional coffee makers (Star Bucks, Tulleys, etc).  These are even better, so I tend to limit myself to one ""special"" coffee a day for now.I am very please with my purchase.  It was inexpensive, makes great coffee, is fast, quiet, clean, and easy to use.  It is truly everything I was looking for in a single serve coffee maker.  While some people may consider the water tank too small, I only tend to fill mine once a day, which seems perfect to me.Pros - Great Coffee, low cost of ownership, a variety of pods that have good to great coffee, nice style, easy to use, power cut off, large enough water tank.Cons - Ok, to be fair, I may be drinking a bit more coffee now.  But, that is NOT the machines fault.  We Seattlites have a hard time controlling our coffee intake.Summary - If you are a moderate coffee drinker and want a nice, inexpensive coffee machine, this just might be the one for you."
Great standard coffee maker. No issues with it so far
Love it! The pods are a bit expensive but my husband now drinks coffee more than ever!
I bought this item and a couple weeks later it starts to leak.  Of course it starts this as soon as the return policy expires!  Be very cautious with this product!
So far it is fine. I love the Keurig pots. Hopefully it will last at least a couple of years
Works wonderfully. I bought some Kuerig coffee. But mostly use my own coffee.
Awesome coffee mashine. I very like it!
Makes a great cup of coffee. The water reservoir allows you to make several cups before having to refill.
Easy to use. Exceptional value. Everything you expect.
"After reading reviews on this one, I waited a few weeks to rate this product and so far, very pleased."
Brews good coffee but the pods are a bit expensive.  Very convenient to use.
im so sorry to hear about people who were unlucky and their machine stopped working properly. my keurig is excellent and i purchased it 8 months ago.
Good product. Love it!
"works well, much like our last one like it, and better than the K2 that we  had to bring back to costco"
Makes a loud sound like running a heavy engine. Cheaply made compare to other Keurig products.
Love it!! Just what we were looking for. Works perfect.
This is an updated version. It seems to be louder and take slightly longer to heat than its predecessor.
Great product that delivers as advertised.
Very nice Keurig and very reasonably priced. I am very happy with it.
I love this!  Its a replacement for my old Keurig.
Not as heavy duty as my professional model but works the same so far
"Perfect for making just one cup of my favorite coffee, tea or coco."
"disappointed in this coffee maker.....can not get the plastic smell outcleaned it multiple times with the k cup cleaner and still spells like plastic, now it's too late to return.any suggestions?"
"Sending it back.  Very cheaply made, coffee weak @10 oz level.  Worst, you can not empty the water in the tank (not the tank on side). So had to ship it back with water in it."
"Very nice, efficient machine.  Only criticism is that the water reservoir is pretty small."
Best appliance I have bought all year
Was replacement for Keurig Coffee Maker that just gave up and died after many years of use.
"Nice brewer, just didn't get hot enough for my liking."
Giving as a gift. Expecting no issues. Same model used in own house
Already having problems with it. Sometimes it makes the small cup when you push the button for the large cup. Will probably have to send it back.
"Great price, great product. $50 cheaper than Kohl's."
This is the second Keurig coffee maker that I have had to replace.  They seem to be a hit and miss with their reliability.  The one prior to this I used for 2 years.  The one before that and this one didn't last 3 months.  Of course it quit working 2 weeks after the return eligible date.  Think I'm going to look at other brands.
Used like 10 times then it just kept running on the heating cycle but wasn't heating up. Irritating. Eventually after shutting it down about 4-5 times it kicked back in. It does make a good cup of coffee though
"I had to send mine back. Defective K55, blew up the K-cups with bubbles."
"was a gift, gut they love it."
"I've had this for over a month now, and so far it is working perfectly. I was a little concerned with some of the bad reviews I've seen. But no complaints yet."
"Absolutely love this machine! Easy to use, easy to clean & maintain. ...fantastic!"
"I decided to finally jump on the Keurig bandwagon after owning other brand single cup coffeemakers over the years.  After reading the reviews, I decided on this model.  Yes, it's pretty quiet compared to what I have been used to, but the water does not seem to get hot enough so the coffee tastes just awful!  I have tried using the pre-made k cups, as well as using the refillable cups, with and without the disposable filters and my own coffee.  The main problem seems to be that the water just does not heat up to the proper brewing temperature.  Does anbody know if there is a way to adjust the heating temperature of this unit?  I have of course, already thrown away all of the box and packing material, or I would return it.  I think I may still find a way to...  This thing is just terrible."
System works fantastic for the price. Extremely pleased.
Very nice and convenient for on the go coffee drinkers.
Easy to set up. Works great.
"works great, however the water container is a little tough to snap back in compared to the older model I had.  However, its easier to fill so I would probably buy this model again."
"Making great coffee, with my brand new Keurig."
This Appliance is an instant classic and a staple
Bought this as a present. I'm sure they are going to love it.
Works great!!!
Great Product!
Coffee doesn't seem especially strong for some reason.  We use the same k-cups with other keurigs and don't have this problem.
This replaced one I had for 5 yrs that I loved ...so far so good!
We purchased this in December and it's already broken.  So upsets and disappointed.  Don't waste your money.
Great coffee maker
good simple machine.  wish it had more features
These coffee machines are awesome
Unit performed as predicted still haven't mastered pods for strength as I don't enjoy strong coffee
Second Keurig - working ok
It was perfect for our small office. No one wants to make a big pot of coffee anymore.
"Coffee does not brew hot, around 160 degrees. Doesn't always brew a full cup."
Very good coffee/tea/chocolate brewing system.
"We haven't used the coffee maker for a long time, but so far we like it a lot. We get more ounces compared to our other coffee maker."
my friend everyday
"Easy set up, easy to use. Takes any K cup type pod. Money well spent."
Works real well.  I particularly like the European flavors in the larger cups.
I love my new Keurig.
As expected. Works well.
"I like the filtered water aspect, as well as, the water holding tank. Much more convenient to use than the single cup unit I had previously."
SIMPLE TO USE. quick.  GOOD COFFEE.
Nice good price
"I love my Keurig ..Had some issue , I reached out to the manufacturer and they resolved immediately!"
"Too soon to tell, but my problem is with the output.  Takes too long to fill the cup."
So pleased ! I don't have to worry about a half pot going to waste now.
works well - packed nicely and its awesome - good value
Works well! Love this coffee maker!
Like this model very much.
"Great price, color is pretty and loved by recipient."
wonderful addition to morning coffee lovers
"We got this as a replacement for an older model and have been a bit disappointed.  One improvement is the intake filtering has been upgraded to a removeable one.  That was what clogged for good on our older model.  This new unit is very basic ... smaller water reservoir with no hinged lid (you have to just remove the top to add water and replace ... no temperature adjustment, although we find the one temp to be OK ... there are 3 volume adjustments, but all are less than the older model ... the largest is only 10oz. ... I guess for a travel mug you could run it through twice.  Anyway, this is the ""basic"" model, and to me a bit over-priced for the features you get.  Another $20 and you could get the fancy one.  All that said, we still love the Keurig process, and would have a hard time going back to the old Mr. Coffee."
Works as expected. Prime shipping went well.
The only thing I miss from my old Keurig was it remembered (allowed me to set) the default cup size.
Love it.  Replacement for a 4 year old one.  Simple to use
works well!
YEAH! I can have my hot chocolate again and my husband can have his coffee
Love love this
Bought for a gift it was well received and liked. Was told it works great and really enjoys it.
Satisfied with product...received as described.
I simply wish the water reservoir had as much capacity as my previous Keurig
"Used a few times in December, then tried to use it the first part of March and it won't work, not cycling."
Great Keurig.  Always has hot water ready for you.
It is so simple to use.
Got it as a gift for my wife.  She loves it.
Second Keurig I have had like the addition of the water filter in this one.
Like the convenience  of quick cup of  coffee.  Wish it was hotter.
"This unit replaced an earlier model. The old one illuminated the water reservoir making it easier to see the water level where the new one does not, making it difficult to know when to add water."
My second Keurig and works very well.  Bought another brand first for $40 but it did not work right due to design flaw.  So would have been smarter and richer to have bought the higher priced Kuerig in the first place!
"Xmas for #1 son, first one, They love it!!"
Large cup setting doesn't fill a regular coffee cup.  Large setting fills it up about half way.
"Got this for my husband and he loves it!! The whole family loves it!! Coffee, tea, and hot cocoa!! It's fast and not too loud at all. And it's a beautiful look!"
Highly recommend !!
Daughter loved the unit---
Coffee just doesn't taste as good as in the old Keurig.
Works great and so easy to use.  Solid purchase.
This is going none stop in our house. One of my best purchases!
"Arrived early, It looks just like the picture."
This item was purchased as a gift. It is used daily without any complaints.
I love it a lot thank you
Works as it should. I replaced an older model that failed.
"It seems to be perfect for our household and frequent visitors. Coffee, tea, hot chocolate...everyone is happy. We wish we had gotten this years ago."
"Had an older model, it died! Love the new one!"
"I bought this Keurig to replace an older model that I had for years that finally burned out. I loved my old Keurig but this new one makes one of the worst cups of coffee I've ever tasted. I don't know if it's overheating the water or what, but the coffee is always tasting bitter & burnt, no matter what brand of K-cups I try. Unfortunately I missed the return window on this, but I will happily eat the $70 to pitch this & buy something else that makes a decent cup of coffee. It's a shame because I used to really love Keurig. But their new brewers are not what they used to be."
I love my Keurig!!! It works great and looks great. I can have delicious iced coffee/ hot coffee within 2-3 mins
Works perfect!!! My whole office is happy
Awesome coffee maker!
Love it... but Have had to replace this twice....planned obsalecence
First time using a Keurig. My husband loves it!
Completely satisfied.
"I'm not a big coffee drinnker but love this I can make cocoa, tea, an cider, lots of things. Just the right amount. Love it"
This is our second Keurig and I would never go back to any other type of coffee maker.
This product saved my life. I'd hate to think of how I would make it through my day without it ;D
"Fits the advertised information.  Convenient, quick, effective."
This has a great size water tank---works in a minute
I love my Keurig. A quick way to make coffee when I am on the go.
Fine coffee maker
Great for work!
This is my first time using a Keurig and I really like it!  It works like I thought it would and I like the size.  Not too big and not too small.  I bought this with a group of 8 co-workers and everyone uses it daily.  We've had it for a month and it is working perfectly.
very good and worth-your-money coffee maker it lasted me 11-12months for just 100$ i believe its a good deal. time for repurchase!!
Purchased for my Wife ( I do not drink coffee)
This is a great way to make coffee or tea very fast and easy.
"Works well, convenient"
Very quick to heat and make coffee.
it was a gift sand the recipient love it
Love Keurig! Must have item.
Great replacement for the same machine.
Runs loud.
Awesome that I can use whatever brand Kcup I want to.
Broken when received.  Trashed
Had to rebuy this so I know what i was getting and I still love it!
"Overall, really like this machine. Easy to use & fast. I wish the water tank was a touch bigger b/c the sensor goes off (wanting to be refilled) long before it is really that low. Coffee comes out great & the best part is no clean up. :)"
Love my keurig ????
works great fast shipping great product
Was waiting for somebody to buy this for me for Christmas. Nobody did so I bought it for myself. Love it.
it is already not working and the return window closed may 11
awesome and fast!
This is great!! 5 stars!!
Works great for my daughter
great--like that it makes more than one cup
Works exactly as advertised
"The Keurig K55 is fine. It was a Christmas gift for my wife. Unfortunately she really wanted a red one.If I want to return it, it's a 20% restocking charge and $8.95 return shipping (Free Shipping to me).I should have found one on Amazon Prime!"
This is my second.... no issues.  good product.
Worked very well
easy to use and meets expectations
This is the best!
"The machine itself is fantastic!! However -- it was received with very faulty packaging -- when I received it, upon inspection of the packaging, I feared that the machine itself would not work!  Thankfully, the machine does work."
"Love it so far, saving me a fortune from not going to starbucks"
This was an excellent purchase.  It was a warehouse deal but it was just like new!
Bought this unit as a second unit for our motorcoach and it is working perfectly...
"Great Product, Arrived on time."
I use this daily and often. Great quality product!
Love it. Works great. Arrived quick.
Drinking more coffee lately and choices are the best. Also guests can make their own!
thanks
Purchased as a gift for my sister along with the suggested coffee multipack.  My sister loved the gift amd was very appreciative.
my cousin loves it.  uses it everyday.
fantastic improvement and nice price too
very handy! works great!
I love my Keurig! It works great! I didn't regret purchasing it.
OMG!!!! The best thing ever & I love it. I brought it for my husband birthday & the whole family enjoying it. It's really a great machine for any kind of gift.
"Wow, great product - love it!"
Listing says k55but model on the bottom shows k40...
Great buy.
works as expected. no issues.
"We love it, we wish we would have bought it sooner.It fits our daily schedule."
"Purchased for out daughter. Although it has less bells and whistles compared to the newer Keurig 2.0 versions,  it still brews a great cup of coffee. Best of all, you are not limited to ""approved K-pod"" as it will brew any k-pod out there on the market that YOU  enjoy."
Received as a gift; absolutely love it! Have used daily since Christmas. No problems!
"This is my first Keurig.  I only drink one cup of coffee in the morning, so this is perfect. No more waste from a large pot."
Great product.
Love it
Our second.  First lasted four years.  Convenient.  Coffee a little expensive but OK.  I recommend it.
Purchased the Keurig K55 Coffe Maker for a wedding gift because I'm very happy with the one I have and use daily.
"after 3 months it started to not work everytime. you'd have to pull the reservoir off and put back on or shake the machine to get the pump to pick up the water. We like using it, but breaking after 3 months. Especially when waiting for coffee in the morning!! Not COol, Not cool..."
Love this machine. Will never go back to a drip or manual machine. Makes the perfect cup of coffee every time.
Absolutely love. Shipped fast and is a great replacement to my old one.
Great coffee maker. No wasted cups of coffee.
Not my first and definitely not my last Keurig.  This was an office replacement and works great!
Great as always from Keurig
Love this coffee maker.
I LOVE my new Keurig!  Price was perfect!
"Just stopped working after 10 days.  Won't brew anything.Cleaned everything, still won't brew.Piece of junk"
kurig is kurig always the best
Just what I was looking for.
Christmas gift for my dad. He loves it!
It is very loud
exactly as described...very satisfied
"Love it, everyday makes my mornings"
My daughter loves it
A great club and it came early. Very very happy. Now if I could find a 7 wood superfast club I would even be happier. Is there one?
Item broke in less than 4 weeks.  Does not heat properly
I use it every morning! The only downside is the noise level.
This is my second keurig!  my other lasted 7 years of very frequent use.  I will always buy this brand!
Got this for my wife. She loves the thing. Easy to set up and operate. Already a daily part of my wife's routine.
Great coffee
I absolutely LOVE my Keurig!
Awesome it takes coupe of seconds to heat up besides that it's great
It is very quite compared to the other two I have had....but not as fast.
exactly what I expected
Got this Dec 3...today is Feb 8..no longer works. When  it is turned on..water pours out..unheated. Amazon window closed..I am not happy.
This is great!
"I was very disappointed with this product, bought the 1st one malfunctions and needed to return  bought a 2nd one same issue had to returned. Iwas so surprised and disappointed. I bought a 3rd, difference company, so far I love it."
My husband loves this. We are having so much fun and no work to it.
It was a gift to a friend that did not have one or heard of it but uses it constantly.
"Arrived in November, used it in December, went on vacation came back in March and when I went to use it, the controls wont work, it keeps asking for water, makes a noise and it stops. Worst coffee maker I have bought my whole life. I am trying to contact seller since it claims to have warranty."
A great addition to my kitchen!
Great price!  I use it everyday!
"Received a few days ago, and I love it!"
My hubby has not stopped using it since Christmas
"Terrible!!!  I haven't even had this for two months, and it stopped working.  Now I have to find out how to return the hunk of junk.  Don't buy it!!  I say other reviews that said it breaks within the first year, and I thought mine would be different.  It is not.  Angry!"
Worked as advertised.
Works just like my old one. Very good product
Working perfect so far (I've had t for about a week). Love it!
Works well-my daughter is pleased!
"just as described, machine makes it a little weak for my taste but it is fine."
Really loving the new coffee maker.
Purchased this for our office and it is easy to use and works great!
Wedding gift. They loved it.
"I don't even want to give this product one star. It was delivered on February 1, 2017 as a result of a return of the same product that broke within I few weeks. Both were gifts for my son and his wife who only wanted the convenience of making a single cup of coffee each day before work. It was used for that purpose from when it was received until this past Wednesday, March 15 and then it broke...only five weeks!!!  It continues to ask for the water to be filled although it is full; before that it just dripped tiny bits of water through and stopped. I am beyond disappointed and will never buy another Keurig product. I am not even bothering to return it for another replacement; it is going in the trash. My question to Amazon is....are these Keurigs ""knock offs"" or is the product just that poor quality?"
"It's a great machine until it breaks, which is generally right around one year."
"This is my 2nd Kerrigan coffee pot love them ,, great cup of JOE!!!"
love this machine. its quick and quite. gets the job done.
"Very good , my first k-cup coffee maker . #10"
Always will love my keurig
quit working within 6 months
works great...better than my 1st one.  Really enjoying our evening coffee and dessert.
"Way easier to operate than a bottle warmer, plus momma gets a cup of tea out of it"
no water filter/ not the same quality as the original
good we use every day
"Awesome coffee/tea maker. Will take your ground coffee in a K-cup. Water is heated quickly, and is hot when coffee is made. Even if you have a crowd, there isn't much of a wait after filling the resevoir for the water to heat up. Would buy again"
Was a gift for someone else!
Great product
Worked beautifully for a while and then stopped working after 3 weeks of use.It was used to make just 1 cup of coffee per day.It doesnt turn on anymore.It was a gift for my husband and I am very frustrated with this product.
"Would give zero if I could. Received on Dec  28, 2017. Used only 4 or 5 times. Stopped working before Jan 26 when we left for vacation. Unaware of Jan 31 deadline to return until I returned home Feb 5. I can see if you just didn't like it but such a short window on a defective product. Ridiculous.'"
work great!!!
I have not had it a 2 months and it's already messed up.it makes coffee one day and the next it won't.im so disappointed.
very pleased
works great
just as expected
Ho ya we love this bad boy.
"extremely cheap for its effectiveness, its sad to read comments in which the machine was defective or useless better said. my machine has been working in an excellent way and im going to buy another as a gift. ps. if you overuse something, trust me its going to break.."
"works good, just seams to be some delay when you first power on and heat water..."
So far working the way is supposed to be.
Never go wrong with a Keruig Makes great coffee
"Standard Keurig coffeemaker. Very attractive price. Works until it doesn't, but that will be a lot of cups from now."
Absolutely worth the price. Period.
"i definitely recommend this keurig i had the k250 which is much bigger and the flavor of both cups are not to be compared this small, simple looking machine has enough power to boost you a cup of coffee which effects will last you for at least 2 hours."
Works great. Makes a good cup of coffee and I love it. I had it for a month and no issues so far. Ask me one year later if it's still working.
Just as advertised
Do I love this thing.  It's a time-saver and the coffee is good too.
There is nothing wrong with the mechanics of this machine but  I wish I would've spent a little more and gone the next level up. This one is not as well made as the predecessor.  Cheap plastic where metal  The previous version used metal.  There is no clocks we can't set it to turn on automatically.  The water chamber is not very good and we find we have to refill after just 2 cups.  It comes with the filter that sits in the water reservoir and we ended up taking it out so we could get two large cups without refilling.  I wish I would've spent a little more and gone the next level up.
Great product.  Bought this one for the office.
Prompt delivery.  Exactly as expected.  No problems.
Loved this machine..owned it for a week and decided to upgrade to the 575.
This is our 3rd Keurig and it's awesome just like all the others!
Easy to use unlike some of the more pricey Keurig brewers.
I got this for the people at work. They seem to love it.
My wife LOVES this
"Keurig coffee machines typically don't last more than a couple of years, I accepted that when I made this purchase. However, this item lasted less than 24 hours of use before failing. Returned item and purchasing a maker from a different brand."
"Can now have one cup of coffee after dinner,instead of making a pot of drip coffee"
"works good, no problems so far"
Perfect  Gift every time.
works great
sometime the machine will dispense the product and other times you have to to keep hitting the cup button. when it work's it's a great machine. don't really recommend buying one. I have had this one about a month and don't think it going to last to long.
This works great and I never has such great tasting coffee.
"Item arrived new in box with all attachments, I have enjoyed coffee every morning"
Not even a week after receiving the machine was leaking water everywhere but thankfully I am able to send back.
"thanks, nice machine makes my wife happy."
Love it!!!
Mom loves it.
Very very loud and flemsy
Very pleased. Excellent product.
"Works fine, but I wish it would come out hotter"
Works great!
Awesome! Love it!
Got this for my birthday and I love it.
unique
great
Works well
It's perfect for me.
"We have only had it a few weeks.  It is noisy, which i don't really mind.  The problem is it works when it wants to.  Returning!"
"So convenient, and I am able to choose from a variety of blends  cocoa, or chai tea, etc. each time I use it"
So far so good....
"Having problems getting it to brew the first cup of the day.  Hit the big button and got 1/8 of a cup, hit it again and got a little more, then hit the small buttton and got a little more all after waiting 15 minutes from turning it on.  Frustrating.  The next cup seems ok."
Good buy
As described. Thanks
Working great - no problems.
"Keep thinking what day will the unit malfunction.  To my surprise, everything is functioning great. Am using refillable pod to save $$ on coffee. Would give 5 stars if the brewer had 1 size larger fill selector."
My entire family loves this thing!
Great brew machine. Worth every penny.
"works well, had one several years ago,but got to expensive to use compared to grinding my own, but now have found several brands online for about .32 per serving, quick easy and out the door quick."
Great
"We received this Keurig a few days ago.  The noise it made when we first started it didn't sound familiar, but we figured it was just different from our older Keurig.  The first couple of brews were fine, but by the 3rd to 4th cup it was starting to not fill the cup.  By the 5th to 6th, it wouldn't even pump water.I love Keurig's coffee when it makes it correctly.  I don't appreciate Keurig's undependability.  We were replacing ours that is only about 2 1/2 years old at most because of brewing difficulties like this.  This is what we got! :-("
its really the best and most perfect gift possible for a person that has to buys coffee on a daily basis. now that i have this machine in my office i don't have to bother my assistants to get me coffee every morning. i simply brewed it myself. it so easy to use.
"I bought this as a replacement for an old K10.  The K55 is much better, and I'm much happier with it.  Has the features I want.  Only complaint is that it makes more noise, but I don't mind that."
2nd one I purchased for another location I have.  easy set up.  came with a water filter too ( unexpected surprise)
"What can I say, it's a Keurig. It replaced a Cuisinart model that failed twice."
Love my Keurig!!  This is my third one.  Completely wore out the previous two.
"So this review would have been glowing...HAD I been able to have my cup of copy this morning. I bought this thing less than two months ago. It was my first ""single serve"" coffee maker purchase so I do a TON of research and settled on this model based on reviews. Yeah, it's a little loud. Yeah, it's really basic. But all I need is my mor nm ING cup of coffee right? That happened spectacularly for the first 48 days. This morning the thing just quit working. Is will not pump water and Amazon says I only had 30 days to return it. Well, I should not have to spend 100 bucks (not to mention the hundreds on coffee and creamer and such) to have coffee for less than two months."
Does exactly what it's supposed to do.
I would have  liked to of had a larger reservior
Works just as advertised.
"Bought this to replace older unit that never dispersed the right amount of coffee. This one is better, but still not accurate as far as ounces poured. The eight ounce setting is actually about six ounces."
Made part of a great gift
We love this Keurig.  Easy to set up and use.
"Haven't used it yet. but, I have one at work and I love it. The reason I bought this one. Will start using it, when I use up all of my un-ground coffee beans I have in house as of now."
Works great
Great!
Love Keurigs
great coffee maker
works great
what I expected
"I simply love this coffee machine!  I have had other Keurig's but this is so much better, it is efficient and works perfectly every time.  The other two I owned were high maintenance and both died at the one year mark.  This one is simple and exactly what I needed - I highly recommend."
"i know nothing last forever,just 5 months old and it brokedown, thanks for the replacement unit."
works great for coffee drinkers who only want a cup or two
best of the lot!
Great product.
If you don't have one of these already - what are you doing with your life.There is not a thing I would change about this item I love it to pieces. My husband and I use this 3-4 times a day!!!!
Love this.  No more waste!!!
"Just love it, flawless so far!"
GREAT DRINK MAKER
"This is our 3rd Keurig and definitely our most favorite.  Was afraid I would miss the timer/clock feature that we had on our previous Keurig but the water heats up so quickly, it is not a problem.  Smaller water reservoir but I don't mind refilling it twice a day.  Definitely love my Keurig!!"
Good quality! Satisfied
nice and simple
Love it
Super fast shipping a real please buy.
Love this thing
It was a gift
Perfect
fine
As advertised!!
I had a Keurig before and was just as I expected.  It is a simply way to make a cup of coffee.
These are so easy to use and work great for about a year then they get scaled up and there is no good way to descale but to run cycle after cycle through and this just takes to long.
This was purchased as a gift for someone but I have one myself and I love it. Keurig is my best friend in the mornings :)
Love Keurig products
"no problems with it, arrived on time."
Good Keurig product.  Slower to brew than last similar purchased
Enjoy it daily
Great K-cup coffee maker!Better then the more expensive one - and quieter!
"great product, wife loves it"
Beautiful machine!
Works good!!!
Was a great price for a Keurig!
"Had it for not even 2 months and it quit working.  I can no longer return it since it has been over 30 days,"
"So far so good, the Keurig is working great with no problems."
No problems!  We love the K55 we have used this particular one for over a year and just got another one to give to a friend.
"It's a Keurig, what else is there to say."
daughter loves this
"I just love my new Keurig!  Easy to use, easy to clean. Great hot coffee every time!"
k cups not provided as box said.
Bought for my elderly mother.  She loves it and it is much easier and economical.
Makes great cpffee.
Love it
Works great
It needs to make a bigger cup.
Best price
"Very nice product. Having three choices for cup size is ideal (especially when a full cup of coffee is needed). The side reservoir is big enough to not have to refill often. Used often, functions faultlessly."
very unhappy- the water reserve sprung a leak within 6 month of purchase
great coffee everytime
great item.
As expected
Arrived as expected. Works just fine.
stops midstream; have to refill water chamber after every 3-4 cups although it claims to hold 48 oz; coffee too weak one time and too strong the next using the same size cup choice.  My previous Keurig lasted 5 years and never had a problem; this one is awful.
Great item!!!!
"We've only had this coffee maker three months and it started making a grinding noise with no coffee coming thru.  I have no idea what happened, but I will never buy another one!"
Very
"We had been using a Mr. Coffee coffee maker and were satisfied with it, however my wife's work has a Keurig and she liked the convenience of the K-Cups.  We purchased this particular model based on user reviews and feedback.  Not disappointed in the lest!  It functions as advertised and produces a cup of coffee quickly.  I like the large water tank on the side, easy to see level and to remove to fill.  I have a reverse osmosis water system at my sink which I use to fill this tank.  I did not install the charcoal filter for the tank because of my RO system.  It has remained crystal clear and free of contaminates even after a month of use.I also purchased the Brewslang Single Reusable K-cup Coffee Filters so we can use regular coffee in it.  Works perfect (as does the purchased K-Cups we have).All and all I have no regrets with this coffee model and brand.  Would purchase again without hesitation."
Came sooner than expected. Great packaging no damage works great!
Good price and works
Would have given it a 5 star rating had they included the K-cup single serve coffee filter with the unit.  Had to wait for my favorite coffee blend until I could get the filter.  Other than that it is a great machine.
works well
2 wordS - works GREAT
Perfect! Great price $
"Given as a gift, but I have one and love it."
Working great - two months and going
I actually love the coffeemaker.  But it doesn't always work!
"I used to have the Keurig mini, but this is better since i can keep the reservoir filled and the unit always on, so that i can get near instant coffee at anytime"
It worked great for the first month. Then it either got clogged or got air into the water line and will only make half of the desired amount.
Good
great machine
I love this product!!
Love!!!
"Nice, simple, we use it pretty much everyday"
was a gift
Awesome!!
"Love it . Bought this for office use , everyone chipped in so it has already paid off for itself . The coffee is as good if not better than what I'd get from Starbucks . Worth it . Good value"
Works great
great
good coffee maker
love it works just like expected came real quick thanks to prime
Works great.
Like new. Very good condition. Works fine. Thanks
The best ever
Was bought as a gift for someone. They are great.
"i wanted to try this item before i gifted it to my mother, ive had this maker for 10 days now and i really like it. it is perfect for a morning cup of cup before going to work, no more driving to Starbucks when i can have my Starbucks k cups at home!"
The device is working great for us
The product is less than 3 months old and has stopped working!!! Water is not flowing... what a pile of crap!
I like the design and the size better than my old Keurig coffee maker.  The taste of the coffee has a plastic taste.  I tried both  K-pod. and grind coffee both tasted like plastic.
very good
great
It works very well as expected. I am satisfied with the unit. I do think the coffee pods are too expensive.
Happy with unit thanks.
Works very well
perfect
good
great price and i use it every day.  same model is about $10 more expensive that here on amazon
This is my second Keurig and I love this one.
Just as advertised. Very convenient and easy to use.
High quality  machine that will make coffee in three different sizes.
Great for a quick cup
great
Love it
Works well bought this so I could use the refillable k cups
Terrible. Broke after 2  months
great
Good
"coffee pot does not work, still trying to get replacement with no avil"
We like this coffee maker and we don't have to use Keurig coffee if we don't want to.
LOVE this
good coffe pot
I like it
Exactly what was needed.
I am hooked.  I never want another kind of coffee maker
What we wanted... use it every day
Great Buy!
Has worked well for two weeks now.
My Christmas gift to myself. I was waiting for the right price and thanks to Brad's deals for making it happen.
Works nice
Totally sucked.  It died on me after a few months.  Never buying this brand (Keurig).  I had a Cuisinart kcup that lasted 4 years...going back to Cuisinart.
Love Love  The Keuring
This machine has stopped working. Please tell me what to do next. It is only a few months old.
Love this easy to use
Nice product
I bought this as a Christmas present for my sister & it stopped working about 3 weeks ago :(It would take 15-30 minutes for the water to heat up & now it doesn't even heat at all... The blue lights don't turn on at all... & it's past the return date...super upset
"Got this a few days ago after loving my friend's Keurig last winter. Here's my thoughts.Pros :*No guessing how much coffee or water to brew  a single cup in a big 12 cup brewer.*Works fine with the reusable k-cups I bought.*Super easy to use. Literally make sure there's water in it, insert a pod, and push a button.Cons :*Wastefulness if you're using the throw away pods.*Price of pods is insane - $0.50+ per cup? Ouch!*Takes a few minutes to heat up and go.*The size options are kinda weird. I get it offers 3 ""standard"" size options, but to fill my favorite mug, I need to use both the largest and medium settings. I measured the output against the owner's manual and its the right output as per the specs, it's just kinda small.So it's not perfect, but overall I'm pretty happy with it. Good machine, worked fine right out of the box."
Love it
Great
Worked as expected always satisfied and it takes all kind of k-cups
This made a wonderful Christmas gift for my mom who is a lover of her morning coffee. It was a great price on a flash sale at 76.50 and I couldn't pass it up.
Even though it's not programmable like I thought I'm still giving 5 stars. Works great and a time saver.
"Revised review after talking with Keurig.  It seems that there is a maintenance issue that I did not know about.  While talking with a Keurig rep, we fount the needle that punctures the K cup was plugged with grounds.  What I am suppose to do, is after brewing a cup, open the top handle and leave it open.  this allows the needle to dry and to keep the grounds in the K cup from accumulating on the needle. The way we cleaned the needle was to insert a paperclip end into the 3 passages that are in the needle.  I did not feel and obstruction, but then we brewed three separate cups of water without a K cup in place.  The first two were filled with grounds, the third was clean.  It appears to have corrected the brewing process and it works now."
"Better than new ones because you can get reusable k-cups for it. And it works like a charm, is more economical, and is better for environment."
"Shipped FAST from NewEgg.  Working as advertised, no complaints.  My wife loves it, and the footprint is about the same as our Cuisinart...which will likely only see wknd work now."
Great machine at a great price.
"Got this in December and my family still uses it everyday, works great."
Great pot
A really great product!!
Good
Worked great for 5 months... then wouldn't brew and return window closed.  Would not buy this product.
"my 4th Keurig and wow are we disappointed!!! This thing puts masses of grounds in the coffee!  Though I had had a bad box of cups but nope! Unfortunately didn't find out inside the 30 day window and now I eat the dollars, real poor product. Maybe I got a lemon, but this is the first time I bought this model..."
"Happy it's working great easy to use, household of coffee drinkers perfect addition."
Girls loved them
Basic Keurig. Works properly out of the box. No complaints. Good sized water reservoir. Heats up reasonably fast and brews fairly quickly.
works great. Awesome gift.
Love it!
Was a gift to family member who is an coffee drinker.  He loves the keurig and we get to enjoy a great cup of coffee at my house or his.
I had my last Keurig for a number of years and I needed a replacement.
As Expected
Use it everyday! My family loves it too. Is so easy to use and clean :)
"unit only works occasionally. I bought the 3 year warrantee, and now can't use it, can't fix it, can't return it.I could not be more unhappy. This was our third and LAST Keurig item!!."
Nice
Thanks
"Love my Krueg Coffee Maker. Makes coffee fast. Coffee water is hot like we like it. No grounds in the coffee. Actually put order in for different coffee maker and this model was suggested by Amazon as the updated version of the maker I was ordering. With my point discount and no shipping costs, it was cheaper than another competitive super store."
"Was a Christmas gift, was just what they wanted"
It does its job.
"Quiet, perfect size. Easy to set up. Very pleased."
"good coffee fast,use any k cup.we had bought a 2.0 and had several problems.old school better"
Love it
Great product and good price...shipping was good
Does exactly what we hoped it would do.
"Wow. It is very cool, and fast."
I bought this product Sept 2016 and it is on the way out. It hasn't even lasted a year. I will buy another Keurig just not this model.
Love it!!
"Bought this to replace a mini Keurig I bought quite a while ago. So far so good! This is a solid coffee maker with all the essential features. No bells and whistles, but it works effeciently and seems to be well made."
"this is the best coffee maker that has crossed my hands without a doubt. the material quality is not top level but the quality of the coffee, meaning: Flavor, Heat, Brew Strength, even the silent brew technology is designed for greatness."
Fast service and works great !
"It made disgusting coffee a few times and then broke. It powers on, makes lots of noise, but never heats up and gets to the point where it's ready. Keurig is all hype; don't waste your money. If you're looking for a good (affordable) coffee maker, go with Melita."
love love love
"I have a few concerns, but overall I am happy with my purchase. This is my first Keurig so I am learning as I go. For new Keurig owners that like to drink tea, it may be difficult to find a variety of the delicious flavors that you are used to in your local stores. Look to Amazon, or I usually do a hot water cycle and leave a tea bag in my cup. If you like loose leaf tea, you need to purchase the filter because this model does not come with one.You may also notice that the water may come out of the machine hot, but it does not stay hot. Plenty of users have complained about this issue, and of the reluctance of having to reheat their fresh cuppa after 5 minutes. I am sure the water is not boiling temperatures. Use your microwave, or do a few hot water cycles after inactivity.My real concern is that I think they took parts from the K40 and put them into the K55! Mine says K40 on the bottom, but the description, and look of the product is K55. A friend of the family got one store brought one for christmas so I will ask him what the bottom of his says.Overall a child could set this thing up its super easy, and you get two filter which last two months each. You can buy them in bulk on Amazon as well.  I'm pursuing my Master's so this machine should come in handy during those late nights. Overall I am satisfied with my purchase. You get what you pay for."
Not working properly- Must turn machine off and on several times to get the water to drop. Can I return it without the original box?  I threw box away.  Very disappointed because I've always loved my Kurigs.
Had to return. Didn't work right.
Good
Up to Keurig's great standards!  We love it!
"Was a great gift, thanks"
I'm very happy with it. It's simple to use and my coffee it great. Doesn't take long at all to heat up in the mornings either.
"Actually love it except for the fact I have to fill it seemingly all the time.  Minor issue of course, and most of the time I don't mind.  Otherwise, it works VERY well and was delivered quickly!"
Not sure I ever lived without this machine. The entire family loves it
Got as a gift for Father's Day.  My dad loves it!
"No blue light in the water tank, can't see water level."
I bought this for my husbands office!!  He loves it!
I didn't think that I would love it as much as I do. Surprise surprise.
"I have to make one medium and one strong setting coffee to get good coffee. Machine works great, but I use refillable cartridges and the coffee is weak unless I fix it."
WORKS ONLY WHEN IT WANTS TO.  1/2 THE TIME IT BARLEY BREWS AND JUST DRIPS COME OUT. GRRR.
"I love it. I was always an old fashioned ""pot of coffee"" kind of guy. I drink coffee all the time now because it is so convenient. The Keurig has performed flawlessly."
Love it!
Just what I wanted
Bought this as a gift for my brother and he loves it.
Very satisfied.  Enjoy the convenience.
"Though I have to fill the water every 4th cup, it is really quick, quiet, and hot coffee every time. Found coffee pods, reusable filters, and filters at walmart for a decent price."
I love my new Keurig with its single cup dispensing!  The coffee and cocoa taste great.
love it
Perfect
So far it is working exactly as I thought it would.  Absolutely no issues with the first 10 or so uses.
Love this Keruig's.
Just what I was needing.
Thank you
Works perfectly and at a great price.
I bought two for Birthday gifts. The recipients love them and enjoyed using them
This coffee maker started making half servings of the size selected. We have had it less than two months. I purchased it because of favorable ratings.
Works great. No complaints.
"Something that I didn't consider when I purchased this coffee maker.  I like really strong coffee.  I use 4 scoops of Starbucks French Roast coffee, that I grind myself.  This coffee maker is really a great idea, but its limited by the amount of coffee that can be packed into a K-Cup.  I even purchased K-Cups that I could pack myself, bad idea makes a giant mess. Yes it has 3 different sizes for a cup of coffee to make it stronger, but I want a full cup of coffee that is the strength I like. The K-cup people are making a killing"
Great Machine a little loud but makes a hot cup of coffee and I can any K cups in the machine
Love this machine !!
"My husband and I are looking for one machine that will brew 1-2 cups of coffee for him and 1-2 cups of coffee for me each morning. We want to avoid having two machines taking up precious counter space.  We also wanted to use our own coffee grinds and tea bags since that is more friendly to both our pocketbook and the environment. We thought this Keurig K55 was the answer. It's not.Before using the Keurig for the first time, we washed the water reservoir and the Reusable K-Cups and ran a cleansing cycle. We read and followed the instructions for using the K-Cups and brewing worked like a charm.Hubby tried to brew a 10-oz cup of coffee with a grind similar to granulated sugar to get the most flavor and he immediately noticed that his coffee tasted weak plus there was a residue left in the bottom of his cup. Here's the problem. The general rule for coffee-making is 2 tablespoons of ground coffee for each six ounces of water. This means he would need to use 3.33 tablespoons for 10 ounces of water. But the Reusable K-Cups hold just over 2 tablespoons -- not nearly enough for a 10-oz  cup.  Also, to avoid the residue he would need to use a more course grind, which would only weaken the flavor further.Next I brewed a 10-oz cup of English Breakfast tea, with a second Reusable K-Cup. The cup emitted a strong chemical odor, but I tried drinking it anyway. The chemical (plastic?) taste was so strong that the cup was undrinkable (poured it into the kitchen sink). I tried a second cup with the same result.Admittedly, we didn't try the K-Cups that are made for use with this machine. But we went into it knowing that we didn't want to and seeing the Reusable K-Cups as a viable alternative. They are not.And so the search continues. Next we plan to try the BUNN MCU Single Cup Multi-Use Home Coffee Brewer, which was rated one of the five best coffee makers by Digital Trends in May 2016."
Great gift
My Keurig QUIT working 2 days ago!!!!  Can it be replaced?
This is just what I need... something easy to work with and I get my coffee in just a few seconds
My Husband and I use this everyday all day . We have even given 3 away as gifts...
Works great and the water filter included was a nice surprise.
"good price! and very solid, easy to use! and look cool!"
works great for me
can't go wrong with this product!
i have always wanted one and love it
I am loving it!!!!
Good as they come!
Machine stopped working 4 days after it was eligible to be returned.  Only made2 cups of coffee a day.  What an expensive lemon.
This is exactly what I was looking for. Recommend it.
love
Throw out your old coffee maker you never look back. The Keurig K55 is by far my best purchase from Amazon.
It already broke down.  Only have had it for 5 months.
"I love the convenience of Keurig, but the frequent cleaning due to scale is inconvenient and expensive.  I still find the instant cup of coffee to outweigh the inconvenience."
"Great coffee maker but the size of the cups are not what they should be. It should be 6 oz, 8 oz, 10 oz, not those off numbers that are too small!"
Really nice
Pleased
Makes great coffee
This was a house warming gift. My lfriend loves it.
Excellent equipmenrt.  I have wasted my life testing other coffee machine. Perfect size and choice of colors.
Great Product.  I use it everyday.
"I purchased this product USED, it has worked great."
"We had a keurig we loved that died, so we had to replace, the model is no longer sold we were trying to duplicate but forget it!  The tank is so small you have to fill it every day and there is only 2 of us.  I wish I had returned."
Great transaction. Highly recommend.
Works great.
Best coffee maker out there. Well worth the price.
I bought this coffee pot 2 months ago and it wont even poor a full cup of coffee on the big cup setting.  I went online to see if there was any feedback on this coffee pot there was a lot of unhappy purchasers.  It's too late for me to return it too.  What an expensive horrible product.
"I was tired of cleaning out my Cuisinart coffee maker every day and after visitng a friend who had a Keurig, decided to order one. Fortunatelty, I didn't throw out the old coffeemaker. At first I was delighted with the convenience and thought that I would just use up the K-cups which came with my purchase and then move onto the more enviornmentally friendly reusable cups where I tried our favorite coffee, but it was very weak. Then I tried some frreshly ground espresso but got mud in the bottom of the cup. I then ordered the paper filters which helped keep out the grounds, but the coffee just wasn't good. I settled on using Lavazzo Perfetto K-cups which are the best of the lot as far as I'm concerned, but they still don't make a decent cup of coffee. The problem is in the process....the water shoots through a little cup in record time and never actually brews anything. By the end of that cup, you are just getting water. I'm giving this away and taking out my old coffeemaker. The Keurig isn't expensive but the K-cups are and the whole system just doesn't work very well."
LOVE THIS COFFEE MAKER.
"Only have it for a month, but so far it is working well. I recommend buying and filling your own pods to save money."
Nice
Broke in less than two week.  Garbage.
This is a great product.
Works great!  Love it!
Nice.
Nothing like a Keurig......PERIOD!
I absoltely love this coffee maker!!
Bought it for work & it works great!
We have used for 1 month and been working great. We had the small personal 1 cup Keurig for almost a year but the last 2 months it did not work well. So gave up...it wouldn't get hot and I cleaned it but still didn't matter..
Love it!
It is great to have a fresh cup of coffee with very little work and no mess. I like the variety of cup size and the automatic shut off.
"I've waited YEARS to get a Keurig & I finally bought myself one for Christmas. Wouldn't ya know, it stopped working in less than a month! And of course the return window is closed already. Awesome!  Guess it's back to the ol' coffee pot! BOOO!"
"LOVE this keurig. Never had a keurig until just recently and don't know why I have never gotten on the keurig band wagon. Quick, easy to use, and makes a HOT cup!!"
"Very convenient, efficient, and easy - coffee tastier"
Loving it
"WORKS FINE, GOOD PRODUCT"
"Love it, makes coffee in the morning easy."
"K55 is a great unit, Keurig classic model, highly rated and can see why, fewer bells & whistles but easier to use, great filter set and starter coffee asst pack also included. All around best bang for buck & great unit!"
Love this model of the Keurig!
Love it.
"Bought this for my husband for xmas this year and already stopped working in March. Tried all kinds of things to get water to come thru without success, think its the pump. Total sucks that I spent $100 and didn't even last 4 months."
"Love,Love,Love <3"
Good
Exactly as ordered! Came with free samples of coffee and tea!
ive read many negative comments but looks like they were unlucky and the machine was accidentally defected since factory because my first machine is working perfectly and it has been 3 months. ps. i use it 3-6 times a day
All I can say is..... COOL
Excellent coffee machine.
Great product.  No knock-offs here
The machine barely works. There is some type of glitch with the filter and water auction point that just keeps the machine running and never fills a cup.
Pretty happy with it all in all but slightly annoying it waits til I hit the button to tell me it wants water. vOv
Could not be more disappointed- 4 months down the road and it stopped working.  I'm going to do what I should have done in the first place buy a cuisinart
"It leaks out of the bottom of the machine after only a few months.  My old one did the same thing, but after 3 years.  I will have to see if Keurig will replace it."
I am now 'officially' spoiled with K-cup's. No more coffee pots
Fair price & prompt delivery made this my choice over shopping local. I got exactly what I wanted.
Very good product.
"I really like the coffee that this brews.No complaints, would buy again"
Just whT I expected.
"Received my Keurig right on time, as scheduled, for Christmas.  It works as advertised and makes a great cup of coffee.  Very satisfied."
I love the fact that you can use your own coffee/ the k pods. I love the coffee brew and Iove that it is single serve. It is easy to use and clean.
Lasted 6 months.
"Great  Keurig, I'm glad I got this. Only thing I wish was different is I wish it held more water in reservoir. This is a great deal since it includes a filter holder with extra filters and kpods. Makes delicious coffee too."
Good replacement
Best coffee machine even though don't drink everyday :)
This Keurig is broken after being used for two months. I have been informed I have passed the return window. It will not heat water. They make the product cheaper than before and do not honor warranty. Pure garbage.
"This Keurig was given great reviews however the one I received gave me trouble the 3rd day I had it.  Everything that was in the troubleshooting section of the instruction manual happened to me!  After a frustrating week trying to get a cup of coffee and enjoy it in the morning, I called Keurig and told them of all the problems I was having with it.  They were very accommodating and sent me a new Keurig K475 which I love!  Not sure if my K55 was a lemon or one that is not that great after all.  I do give the Keurig Company a high rating because they were very professional in my dilemma and not only replaced my K55 but sent a more expensive model instead!"
Start my everyday with this machine.  Easy.
stopped working after 4 months...not worth the money
works great
Doesn't  get hot enough.
Gift
"I loved my B60 model but it was old and eventually stopped working.  This model is similar in most ways except it is clearly more cheaply made.  Everything is plastic, as compared to the chrome on the prior models.  So what I did was unscrew the plastic handle and replace it with the chrome handle from the B60 model.  Looks SO MUCH better.I also miss the LED light in the water reservoir.  It was such a great, modern touch on the prior model.  This one always looks so dark and bleak.A couple positives though: it runs more quiet than my last model.  Also, it comes with a water filter which you used to have to buy separately for the older models."
Works Perfectly. Love it with my K Cups.
Makes a great cup of coffee!
Very happy with my Keurig!!
Was given as a gift to my parents and they love it.  :)
I love this machine!!!
An earlier model wore out and this is a replacement.
Works well
"Great, as expected.  But, instructions did not mention the water filter, which was enclosed.  Is it necessary?"
so far we love it!
GREAT product
Perfect coffee maker
Love this thing
I bought on Amazon and after 1 month it completely stopped working and I cannot make coffee.  I just missed the return window and I am stuck having to buy another Keurig.  If I could give 0 stars I would.  DO NOT BUY!!!!
This is saving my daughter about $6 a day.  No more Starbucks stops everyday!
I gave as a Christmas gift to my parents and the maker is broke the motor as gone bad.
Works wonderfully!
Very satisfied.
Wonderful perfect coffee
"This product only worked for two months and stopped working. The power doesn't not turn on, the brew selection menu is not working. The product life time is two months. I am not happy about the product quality."
"It's to find this model, the keriug 2.0 models got poor reviews ??"
Works just like the old one that it replaced.
Wife loves it
I don't drink a lot of coffee-maybe 3-4 cups a week when it's cold. This Keurig has worked perfectly every time! Love how hot the coffee is when it comes out! Perfect for when I have company that drinks coffee!
"On the second delivery, first one worked for about 2 weeks.  Returned and Amazon delivered another one and have used this one a little over a week.  We shall see if it last more than a couple of weeks."
"I've been a Keurig user for several years and had flawless use of my prior Keurig. This model has major design flaws that caused it to fail over and over again. I couldn't brew coffee easily, it's very noisy, and the volume of coffee produced does NOT match the button you've pushed on the top. This is now my 2nd shot at this K55 and I've finally given up. I filled the reservoir, placed the K cup, pushed the button for 9.25 oz and got a lovely 6.25 oz cup of COLD coffee! It's going back like the first one from last month. When I called customer service at Keuring, they told me it needs a needle cleaning. Hey, a product that needs a needle cleaning after brewing only 12 cups of coffee has major engineering problems! The whole point of a Keuring is convenience, and a product that needs regular needle cleanings is NOT convenient."
does a great job.
So far works just great.
Love it
I have the cheap little one and love it but this model is even better
Stopped working after ONE month!!!
Second time I've bought this because I have the odors one to a family member. Had to have another one
LOVE it!
Fits into  my K15 and K55. Easy to use
"This was bought as Christmas gift for my daughter. She has told me it works great!! Uses it for hot water, apple cider, hot chocolate and some instant soups. She is really pleased with ease of use as well."
Love it  Great
not long ago my wife purchased a machine and im very surprised given ive always used Cuisinart for our whole kitchen this keurig machine has been quite effective. much more effective than my Cuisinart brewer...
I got this Keurig K55 (refurbished) from Amazon for $53. It works perfectly. Lets see if it holds up over time.
Works great
great
gave for a gift
Really like it.
Love Keurig - no other way to brew coffee.
"Bought this for my friend, I have the same one and love it. I do recommend cleaning it regularly though, the water does get built up in there after awhile."
Love my keyring. Used several times a day.
Somebody used my coffee maker before it got to me.  One of the sample coffee was gone and one of the water filters was missing and the other was already installed and still wet in the tank.  Otherwise it seems to work alright.
Love this Keurig!!!
"coffee maker is fine, but shipping packing fell apart at the door"
Works great
Wife loves it!
Does not work at all!
love it
"Its  about 5 weeks old and its not working right. I have another model at my second home that so much quieter and fills 6oz,8oz,or 10oz.  This one does less and is hard to get a decent strong cup of coffee. Its slow and very noisy Dont Buy This One."
Works great
works very well.
Bought as a replacement of the same coffee maker. New product was as expected.
"I bought this a year ago & I loved it.  It did break after a year & with this repurchase, I will keep using the filter & buy the descaler so hopefully, it will last longer than 1 year.  It makes great coffee!"
We have only had the coffee maker for 6 weeks.  It is no longer working properly.
"Quick and easy to use, it's used for the nurse's they love it a great buy."
As expected.
On a camping trip ( in an RV) this is a brand new keurig and it glitches...doesnt brew a cup then it does...dont mention descaling...this is NEW....dang and when on a trip u NEED it to work. ugh
It does what it is supposed to do...no more and no less.  It replaced its twin which served faithfully for several years.  Happy to welcome new member to family.
Always a wonderful gift! Who wouldn't want one of these??
I own three! Bought the latest for my girlfriend. She raves about it.
I've had 4 Keurigs and this is the absolute worse one I've ever owned!! The water storage thing is toosmall and it takes forever for it to start coming out. The noise level is awful too. I wish I had returned itbut I waited too long.m
"If only 0 stars were an option. These machines are junk. This one replaced one which died after 18 months of fairly light use. This new one worked the day I unpacked it but not the next. This was our 4th, and last, Keurig. We went back to Mr Coffee."
Coffee pot was as expected
"Great coffee maker if it works, the two I have purchased have both failed.  This one lasted 8 weeks.  It works fine if you are just heating water, doesn't work if you have a Kcup in it.  That applies to Dunkin' Donuts, Newmans Own and Green Mountain Half-Caf.  I purchased the K55 to replace a failed K45 that lasted longer (6-9) months, but also failed in the same way.  I have no idea what the problem is.  Are re-manufactured items being sold as new?  Why aren't others complaining?  And I'm going to check to see if I have been refunded the purchase price on the first one, that process has been long and drawn out, and included my having to pay the shipping costs back.  This has been, by far, the very worst experience I have had purchasing merchandise online.  And I've been very surprised, and very disappointed, to have it be Amazon."
Nice
"This was  to my dad who appreciated the on I have.  Says he used to make 4 cups a day, and throw 3 of them away.  Now he does it one at a time, perfect every time."
Love it... plan to buy another one for our motor home.
Great.
It has 3 cups sizes and is quieter than my old one.
"Bought this to replace our old machine, but it is NOT the same!  VERY loud, water tank smaller, and it stopped working after only a month and a half.  Very unhappy and plan to try to return."
Love my coffee maker
thanks
wont drink coffee any other way
It's working out well with all the use it gets. Third week in it stopped brewing -had to resolve the error codes.
The Keurig is awesome!  We love it!
Love it. So much simple to use!
Awesome!
"super happy with purchase! thank you so much, item just as describe!will buy from this seller again!"
Everyone should have something like this. It is tall enough to handle reasonably tall cups.
"Its percolates, coffee smells good and taste great. What more can you ask for?"
Easy to use.  Takes ALL K-cups from all companies.
Water not as hot as I expected.
"Bought this in December, and it has given me little problems starting a couple months after the purchase. Now has stopped working altogether.. very unsatisfied."
We sure made the right choice with our Keurig K55.  No more wasted coffee from a pot that produces 6 to 12 cups.  We love the taste of just the right strength.
Very pleased with Keurig K55 Single Cup--a fast cup of coffee!
Love it!
"Great price, Great service and a Great product. Nothing else to say."
We are very happy with this coffeemaker
Kids love it
this item is great and my wife loves it uses it everyday
We love this Keurig! Family of 5 enjoy it daily. Super simple with a few options
"Excellent convenience item, heats fast, brews a perfect cup of coffee."
nice product
Works great.
Love the coffee and tea.
Lived up to everything I was told it would.  Probably the best Keurig model out there.
"I really love this!  I'm the only one who drinks coffee in the house, so making single cups as I want them is GREAT!!!  And, the family is enjoying it for tea and hot chocolate!"
"Great product, used daily,  nice quick cup of coffee, our guests love it,  would recommend it,"
Had to return the first one after 2 weeks as it stopped passing water from the water chamber to the brewing mechanism. The second one has so far lasted over a month (as you would expect from Keurig) so I guess we got a lemon at first.(+) compact. Fits easily on top of the office mini fridge with enough space for an electric kettle beside it(-) takes a while to brew. That's ok for us as the office is small and not a huge line up for coffee(/) it can sometimes be tough to determine when the cup has finished brewing. Especially if there is a talk mug (e.g. Travel mug) under the spout. There is no clear sound difference to indicate it has finished.Overall - for the price it's worked well for a small office and we are happy now that we have a working one.
"great,just what i wanted"
"Easy to operate, great price."
love it 48 oz water tank and registered it online and received 50% off kcups from keurig
This was my second purchase.  I like it very well.  I would buy again.
"Completely disappointed - purchased this Keurig for my customer lounge, I had a customer go to use it and it doesn't work at all. So now I am out almost $200.00 because I have to purchase a new one"
my wife drinks the coffee so one cup is just right for us seeing that I don't drink coffee thanks
I love my Keurig; the coffee as well is delish.  Great buy.
After waiting almost a month I finally got my coffee maker!! It is exactly like I wanted and am very pleased with it!
Love it.
It's great!
This was a gift for my son and his wife. They love it and use it every day. The shipping was fast and they tell me it functions very well.
"I am very disappointed in this model. I had a different model of a higher quality for years until it finally died on me. I ordered this model because I mistakenly thought it was the update if the one I previously had. Upon receipt of this model I was very disappointed. The quality is shoddy. I feel like it's only a matter of time before the junky, loose fitting plastic breaks when I lower the handle to brew a cup. Within two weeks the pins were already getting clogged, which continues to happen too often. I happened to purchase a higher quality model for my grandmother a short time after purchasing this for myself. For only $20 more it was of far superior quality. All in all, I say spend the few extra dollars and get a much better product."
We made the decision to reorder the same model as the old one acquired more than 6 years ago stopped working (maintenance neglect on our part  :- )
"Garbage!!! Used since Christmas, no longer works. Complete waste of money. I've had $15.00 coffee makers that lasted longer than this junk."
Will use kcups of all types...shame on Keurig for coming out with ones that have to be theirs...
"Put the original $94.94 back on my card ending in 5055.  UPS came with a different tracking label number than what you sent for me to print.  The newer label has a tracking number of:  1Z3Y51817809502028.  The one you sent me to print-out that was not used was:  1Z3Y51819009501998.  I did not use this machine.  I only took it out of the box because Keurig wanted to know the serial number behind the drip plate.  Keurig has a new, actual, K55 on it's way to me at no cost.  What I got from you, and everyone is getting from you, and Walmart, etc, is a K40 inside a K55 box.  Inside the brown box is the Keurig box that reads, Keurig HOT K55 Classic Series.  I bought the 3 year Asurion warranty.  If I needed to send it in for work with them, they would refuse to fix it because it was a K40.  I know, I used to own an Allstate Agency in Arlington Virginia (927 s Walter Reed Drive, at the NE corner of Columbia Pike and S Walter Reed Drive).  So I'd advise that you let Asurion know about this, otherwise, you will have a ton of customers down your throat.  Keurig would not give me in writing that the models were actually the same, even though I was told they were by 2 CSR's, before I got beyond their ranks.  You have a big problem on your hands.  You had better pull the added warranty option off of this item, and write a letter to everyone who has purchased an extended warrantee on it to let them know that they are still covered.  You have to hash that out with Asurion first.  The K40 and the K55 are basically the same model, but the K40's were made quite some time ago."
second round! i bought this machine at the beginning of the month and my parents saw it through skype and want one so bad.. im going to send them one in order for them not to go out to get coffee
Great
Coffee now no waiting
I Love It
Hope this one last
Just Love It. Like that it shut off after a couple hours.
No longevity to this product. Have had it for only six months and already starting to fail. Only fills cups about half way now.
does not give you enough coffee for the tall cup setting.
Love this thing!
great
better coffee always taste the same as the last cup and no coffee ground mess
"after I cleaned the pot as it directed, it died.  I have only had for 3 months.  They will not return or exhange"
my dad loves it
"Oh so fine. I can finally make my own coffee in a matter of minutes, instead of waiting for my tight ass lazy gf to get up and make me a pot for the mornin ye"
Wish I had gotten this long ago!
Love it! This is so much nicer than my old smaller Kuerig. It is so nice and easy to use.
I have used Keurig for several years. This product still meets my expectations.However it does not come with a separate pod holder for your own coffee. I bought that separately
My college nephew thanks you !!!!
I gave the K55 as a gift and they loved it.
To replace a B70 so the comparison is a bit unfair but a better alternative to the 2.0 version since I have a full inventory of the original k-cups.
"This item seems to work fine so far but I was not impressed with it's construction.  The brewer we had before just seemed to be put together with better quality materials.  It is all cheaper plastic now, even the drip plate."
Works  as expected. Got here fast.
I received this Keurig one afternoon. After reading and performing the set up directions I made one cup of coffee. The next morning the water was coming out of the vent (reservoir) area.  I am sending this back asap.
Just what I wanted.
"Very nice product, brews like a savage."
"I got this as a gift for my grandmother after she fell in love with mine, it arrived on time and is in perfect working condition it made for a great gift and I will look forward to this brand making new things. Thank you so much"
Exceeded expectations.  Very easy to use and results in a great cup of coffee.  Very sorry that we didn't get one sooner.
"Very nice, so easy to make coffee, and everyone can have a different kind., I like it especially because I drink decaf and no one else does."
love this machine. recommend to anyone
I love the coffee maker that my husband bought for me for Christmas.  Could not have gotten a more perfect gift!!!
"Great Keurig, this makes my coffee hot just like it says. Love it."
Improved over last one. Works very well.
Great to be able to have a cup without brewing a whole pot...
LOVE IT!
Good to the last drop
Love my coffee
"We bought the model that was the best replacement for our older model that did five different cup sizes.  It lasted over two years and we absolutely loved it.  It stopped brewing and after all possible troubleshooting measures were tried and failed, we broke down and bought this model to replace it.  We're not as happy with it.  It's only got three cup sizes and it brews somewhat inconsistently.  We must have oversized mugs in our home because we have to brew twice to fill up our mugs.  The water container doesn't have the same large capacity as our older one either.  So we've had two disappointing features so far, but we're making do.  If we could get our old one fixed and brewing right again, we'd go back to it!  If you've got tiny cups for coffee, this will probably make you happy.  We're big on mugs and big on coffee and this one leaves some features to be desired."
Love my Keurig.  So handy for different choices of coffee.n
"Smell coming out of pot, water didn't fill cups, returned and got 2.0"
Arrived as expected. The only problem is the top does not stay up as my old one did. Otherwise it works as expected. Love the convenience of the Keurig!
works great
Wrong color
Made two cups of coffee then it plugged up. Not the first one to be sent back. Junk
Great for a quick cup of coffee.
Works great.
I bought this for my son.  He loves it.  It is so quick for him when he is in a hurry.  I would recommend this to everyone.
Ground level model. Works fine.
great
PERFECT!
"Gave as a gift, show my sister how to use she loves it.  Very simple to use."
Works great and doesn't take up much counter space!
Great product. I had the same one for the house and bought a second one for my office. Competitive pricing compared to other websites or even in store. Highly recommend!
The coffeemaker was what I expected for the price. The only negative is the capacity of the water container.  My old Keurig had a larger and more convenient capacity.
Arrived on time...easy to use...good coffee
As expected
"This machine is very erratic in the amount of water it produces from pressing each button; that is,  it will give out more water or less water when the button is pressed.  It is undependable, so has to be watched.  Also, the tank holds at least 1/5 of the tank of water when the ""add water"" light comes on, so it functions with less water than expected before having to put more water in the tank.  I have to literally slam down the tank full of water  for it to engage enough for the water to be pulled into the heating unit.  I can tell by a grinding sound that the water is not being transferred.  Have to lift up the tank and drop it down and sometimes slam it down in order to work.  ANNOYING."
I spent almost $100 for this coffee maker last Oct.  It has already stopped working.  Buyer beware this is a piece of junk!
"This is my third Keurig purchase  for personal use or as a gift.  Obviously, I feel it is a top quality product."
Thanks nice
Wonderful Machine.  Lives up to all expectations.
Bought it for my husband at work and he loves the cup size selection ability.
"Update Dec 2016:  Totally unreliable unit.  Not recommended.  I was reluctant to buy single-serve unit, but decided to try it for convenience. Its working well. Had a little trouble using pods after manually refillable unit was used.  The reason we realized was that the the poker needle had grounds in it. When we cleared it, it worked again with pods.  So when using the refillable unit in the future, we realized that after filling it (but before using it), must clear the center area of coffee by sticking pinkie finger or something.  This keeps grounds away form the poker needle. After doing this, machine is working more reliably.  It is very convenient, and coffee is good. No more arguments over coffee!  Everyone happy!"
love it! Very easy to use and amazingly fast brewing.
Nice product works well
Love it!
Nice. Wish I could brew a larger cup though.
great
"Love, Love my keurig  !!"
Coffee is more expensive.
"Had one before for years, sold it in a yard sale, decided to get another,  and this works just as good, exactly as it should"
Enjoy using this coffee maker.
"Works fine, much cheaper here than at stores."
"Very nice, easy to operate.. Love the water holding unit built in.."
Love it!
goood
Makes an easy cup of morning coffee.
Brought this for my husband for his Birthday and he loves it!!!
need i say more...
The reservoir could hold more but other than that it's perfect!
This was a Christmas gift.  She loved it!
Works great with no issues.
"I'm so disappointed in Keurig. What started as a quality, innovative company with well-made products has morphed into a corporation that churns out cheaply made, thrown together products with faulty components. I have had several Keurig machines over the years, and have come to terms with the fact that they only last a year to two years with daily use and purified or distilled water ... but this latest one went out after three weeks of use. If you're a Keurig owner you'll recognize the sound of ""uh, uh, uh .... bzzzz ... click"". Yep, the pump went out. The water is already trickling out of the top valve as well. Never again."
Great backup to full pot machine
Love it so far. Hope it continues to work.
Love this Keurig coffee maker! Works great and I like the fact that it filters my water for me to help keep the machine clean .
Everyone in the family loves it...especially on those days when you need a quick hot drink to-go!
It was a gift for my college granddaughter.  I have the same one and we  both are very happy.
Gift for elderly mother-in-law she loves
This is the second one i have owned. The first lasted about 2 years than stopped working. The second only 5 months.
So much more complicated than my original one cup without water well. I liked just pouring water in at top and pressing what I wanted.  This new one is more steps.
Coffee maker does not brew properly very unhappy
Love it!
"the machine works and everything, but my coffee always comes out watery, i gave it some time and tried differently k cups but they all always come out watery, regret buying this."
"All good at this time, great convenient coffee."
"Cheap and noisy.  My old Keurig lasted ten years-- I don't expect this one to do so, should have spent a few $ more for a better one!"
Brewed weak coffee. No provision for stronger brew. Sent to back and bought a K575. Much happier now.
Not happy- I've only had this for 8 months and its not working properly.  I'm returning it and buying a different brand.
After less than 2 weeks it would only dispense 2oz of coffee at a time.!  The internal reservoir was filled so sending this thing back was a lot of trouble.
Love it
"This is my second one in five year's,my wife loves it!!!"
The product description listed says it is programmable but it definitely is not programmable...very disappointed!!
Great!
good
Pump stop working after 6 weeks. Could not return the item and cannot contact seller.
Love my Kerig. Though I wish there was just a hot water option for tea.
We love it.
"great machine, just need to find a pod I like, Don't like water downed coffee taste"
"Simple to use product and adjustable to size cup or amount desired. Variety of flavorings available in coffee, tea, or hot chocolate. Great product. Would like to see WiFi connectivity and app to start with I-phone."
Love it!
Works great.  Perfect size.  Came in a very timely manner and in great packaging.  Product was exactly how it was described.
Constantly needs water. And it wont stay open when you replace cups.
"works great.  not much variation in cup size when brewing., All three options put out close to the same."
Makes great coffee and hot chocolate.
Very satisfied with it.
It works fine just like all the other ones
excellent machine
"When I received it, that water container was cracked and whenever I add water, it would start leaking. I've resolved the issue temporarily, but other than that I got it for a good deal and still works pretty good with it ""fixed"""
Great for use in the office.
works well for us.
love our new Keurig for our office break room. So far 20 cups of coffee and all great. Machine works as expected.
"TL:DR- I love this coffee maker. This is my 1st coffee maker and when (or if) it breaks I plan to buy another!I used to spend a lot of money on coffee. This was almost exclusively bought at Starbucks. The only time I'd drink coffee-machine or homebrewed coffee is at friends' houses and I thought nothing of it.  After another year of doing taxes, finances, and trying to trim my expenses, I noticed that purchasing Starbucks coffee 4-6 times a week was quite an expense.  I cut coffee for a few months and then I noticed this item on sale for Prime Amazon members.  After searching through the reviews and questions, I went for it and bought it.  This thing is amazing. At only the click of a button, within a minute you have 1 (or more) mugs of delicious coffee.  Initially I bought a mixture of 30+ different k-cups, but after trying many of them I have found my favorites.  Instead of spending $25-35 per week and upwards of $1800 per year on coffee I can buy the k-cups en mass for super cheap at under 1$ per mug (and each cup can be nearly 2 mugs if the lady wants some coffee as well).If you like coffee but are tired of the high cost of coffee shops, I strongly recommend checking out this coffee maker."
"Have had product for a month, working great. This morning, stopped working completely.  Are some noise spit out a few drops and that's all.  Going to try and return or get a replacement."
"Didn't work from the day I got it. Water would not drain into the cup. Nothing happened. The 2 times it made a cup, it tasted disgusting. I'm hoping this one was just a lemon."
My fiance and I are loving this machine. Worth every penny
Great Keurig...until it stopped working only a few months after purchase. :(
I love this product but the tank is very slippery when wet. I dropped it when filling it and now it is cracked. If I would have known I would have filled the tank using a cup of water instead.
Got one for my fiancé for Christmas and loves it. The shipping was so fast :^)
"this coffee maker has changed my life. from hell to heaven i would say and by the way, i dont have to spend a penny in Starbucks when i got this amazing brewer at home."
Great deal
Great what I expected
Love it! Simple to use! Great shipping!
Boyfriend loves it. !!
easy to use great coffee nice and hot
Omg never imagine life without my own coffee pot til I got a Keurig K55.
Stopped working in the first month.
enjoying it
Great price and fast ship
Very good.
We have been using this Keurig K55 for 2 months. I would guess it has made between 5 and 8 cups daily without a single problem. The option to use any k cups was the selling point for us. There are very good options on Amazon for k cup samplers which has been fun sampling serveral different brands and flavors. I would recommend this as an inexpensive option to try a k cup brewer and many different brands of coffee.
does a good job
Love it!
Looks nice and works well . Bought mainly because I'm a coffee drinker and my wife only drinks cappuccinos or hot chocolate. Was wasting a lot of coffee with old coffee pot. Would recommend to anyone looking
"Had to wait as it was out of stock, but well worth the wait.  Like new."
Love the product. 2Nd one I bought. Just wish there was a bigger resevoir.
"I received the K55 as a Birthday present in September. Works fine and delivers a good cup of coffee, every time. There are three drawbacks to the design and this may not bother, others but worth noting. 1) The brew sizes are limited to 6oz, 8oz, and 10oz. A 12oz brew would be preferable as I have to use the 6oz brewing cycle, twice with one KCup to achieve the 12oz cup I normally drink. 2) The 48oz water container may be fine for some, but I fill it much more often than I would like and the machine consistently indicates ""add more water"" and will not brew when there is approximately 8oz of water remaining in the reservoir. 3) Many travel mugs, do not fit under the brew head, even when the bottom tray is removed.  Still a well-made product and does what it is supposed to do. Just wish the developers had put a bit more thought into the functional design."
"My dads old Keurig gave out.  Replaced with this one, so far so good."
The product just died! Hadn't even lasted a year!!!
"4 months old and it is making a half cup, just like the last one.  A piece of junk. Do NOT buy."
"I like it a lot. I received it on Dec. 29, 2016 and it stopped working.  It tells me it is out of water, but the decanter is full.  How do I go about getting a replacement?"
2 day service...works very well.
Bought this as a Christmas present for our daughter-in-law.  SHE LOVES IT!!!!  That's all I know......and that's all I NEED to know!
Love it. Makes a great cup of coffee.
good product workes good
Happy to have one back in kitchen.  Accidentally bought the individual serving one last time and I hated it.
Love the fresh coffee.
Excellent as usual for a Keurig product.
"Wonderful! If you're a coffee person like my wife, you have to buy one."
"Great coffee, easy to use!"
"So far, no leaks. I have had too many coffee pots that leak after I buy them or latter down the road.This model is good for an individual."
I am disappointed that the water reservoir holds less than my original and does not have hinged lid for same. It is also slower to make a cup than previous maker. Why can't you leave a good thing alone?
great
It does the job.
Gave as a gift and the recipient loved it!
"Love it, enjoy it every day, very practical and time saver."
great machine wish we would have bought one sooner.
I absolutely love this thing! It even came with sample K pods and 2 water filters! I received it super fast as well in one day
"Very easy to use, light weight and love the color."
"Bought as a gift, friend uses it every day and loves it!"
"not reliable, terrible, half the time doesn't make any coffee"
"Love it!  Wish the Kcups were a little cheaper so you could enjoy more flavors  - purchase the sample packs with a variety, some of the coffee is really strong!  Machine itself is great."
I love my Keurig.
"I was a Keurig snob. What I mean is that I failed to understand why anyone would pay so much money for a coffee maker. Seemed rather hoity-toity to me. I enjoy a cup in the mornings, but never took the time to program my regular pot to make the coffee. Even when I did, I had a hard time getting the strength right. And then, of course, you have to wash the basket and the carafe......just too much trouble for this busy girl. Work took me to our downtown office where there are Keurigs all over the place, different models too. I think that was what changed my mind, after a few weeks. It was so convenient, fast, and clean. So when I got Mother's Day Amazon gift cards, I decided to treat myself to a little hoity-toity. I had decided I liked this model, due to the reservoir and the cup sized choices. I bought some plain ole Folgers Classic K-cups, that were on sale. Got the machine the day after I ordered it, thank-you Amazon.I love that you can use a travel mug. My favorite one holds exactly 2 cups. I used one K-cup, and set it for the 8 oz. size, lifted the lid, put it back down and chose the 6 oz. size. This left a little bit of room to add my favorite creamer, when I don't want black coffee. Yes, I used the same K-cup! The coffee was delicious. No plastic taste or anything, like I've read in some of the reviews. I use filtered water from my Brita pitcher and I also put the filter in the reservoir, that came with the machine. Maybe that helped. I don't know. The coffee is also very hot, even after I add my cold creamer. The first day, I just had it black and the first sip burned my tongue! Much hotter than a drip machine, but I like it, because my coffee is still hot when I get to work. I'm so happy that I got this and can have a cup in the mornings with no fuss, no muss and very little time.I also researched many other brands, hoping to spend less money. After reading many reviews, I decided that in this case, you get what you pay for, so hope I'm right!"
"this is the best machine ive purchased in quite a long time. ive used cuisinart,mr.coffee,nespresso,etc. and this machine is my final and indisputable choice."
Purchased as a gift. My friend was happy with the product.
Nice
"This was to replace a discontinued similar model of Keurig which we used for 5+ years and loved it, before it finally quit (it made really hot coffee).  This K55 had all the familiar features but the first thing we noticed was that the coffee it brewed wasn't even close to being as hot as the previous Keurig.  Prewarmed coffee mugs as usual but to no avail. Very dissatisfied with this unit, so I returned it and will continue my search for another coffee maker."
Easy to operate.  Brews a good hot cup of coffee.
The water reservoire started leaking. I think the new filter output is the fault. It needs to be in place very securely.
"I love my Keurig, it's very convenient since I'm the only one who drinks coffee. No more making to much. And the k-cups are inexpensive as well."
"I was going to return this only because I was so in love with my first ""original"" one, and when I noticed they're not made as sturdy as before, it confused me. But after a few cups I'm most definitely keeping it, now to see how long it last.Update: I did return it for the K475 model, because if i'm gonna spend that much money for my coffee, I might as well spend a little more and be completely satisfied. And I'll say, it's well worth the extra 25 bucks I spent."
Great gift. My wife loves it.
Loved it. Very convenient.
Love it
Makes a great cup and fast.
My keurig has brewed many cups of coffee and it's been perfect every time. So far so good.
The Keurig is easily assembled and performs very well.
Absolutely Love it
"Ordered as a housewarming gift for son,he loves it!!"
This is a great coffee maker
This is a much better option than the single serving Keurig. Easy to setup and works great.
I love this Keurig; have one and purchased this for a gift.
Worked great for about  year. In the process of trying to file a claim to get a new one as it makes a loud noise when drawing water from the reserve water tank.
"Not as nice as the Keurig Limited Edition we had for about 3.5 years before it totally quit pumping no matter what repair tips that worked in the past. Seems to have a smaller water container, same functions, not as nice looking as the Limited Edition, kind of cheap looking dull plastic, but then again most all coffee makers are all plastic, but at least some are more pleasing to the eye! I feel Keurig make them junky so you move to their more expensive 2.0 version that also limits your coffee brand selections due to their code reader on the 2.0!  So far working well, but have only been using it for a week.  So a complete verdict is still out!"
"I like it very much, easy to use and very convenient to have around as it gets ready very quickly for just one or 8 cups of coffee.  Love it."
Only worked a few days and then would only fill the cup half full.
"What can I say, it's a Keurig.  The price was right!"
"When it works, it great. The first one failed after about one month. Keurig sent a replacement. The second one failed after about one month. Keurig has not responded this time."
My son loves it.  He's 15 years old and always wanted one to help wake him up for school. If he keeps getting good grades I might get him the coffee cup tray for underneath it.
"Perfect for your cup or 2 of morning coffee, and with simplified and improved ""programming"" vs previous models."
I just wished it held a little more water other then that I love it. I live a fresh cup a coffee and the keurig makes it possible for me to have every time ??
Flimsy.. not as rugged as the first one I had.
"Was great for about 5 months until it just stopped working correctly.  This is the 3rd time we have owned a Keurig, we love the ease of it, but not the fact we have purchased 3 in 2 years."
it's great just as advertised
This basic model is a big performer. I like that there were 2 extra filters for the water reservoir that was included. Very pleased with this purchase.
love it
We've been through three (yes three ) of these in a year. They keep breaking.
WORST THING I EVER BOUGHT
Good coffee consistently. Easy to use and clean.
Operates as advertised. Delivered in working order on time.
"Our 1st one lasted 6 years, I broke it myself"
It's difficult to find any faults with a Keurig.  Perfect
lasted 1 and 1/2 years
It's the best!
i have purchased many different keurig models going back to 92' but this has been my favorite one. its extremely easy to use and the coffee is perfect.
This has really been great since I only drink one cup of coffee every so often it's the easiest thing around
"I bought this for our office.  Everyone loves it, and they can all have what they want to drink."
"we love it, if you wanna give something  this is one of the best thing you can give to someone."
Good coffee maker. I would recommend this product to anyone.
This is the second K55 I've owned. Liked the first one so much I ordered another one! The first K55 lasted about 5 years.
So convenient and easy to use.
"love this specific model to much, its so efficient, Sending it to my parents is this very moment! thanks for the positive feedback was really helpful!"
"This is my second Keurig, same model. The first one lasted several years, but I made the mistake of cleaning it with straight vinegar. Don't do that."
I definitely like this coffee pot! I like that every cup is fresh. It's great to have the water canister so you don't have to fill every cup to pour it through.
Works great and love the coffee.
Awesome!
"it has been satisfying so far, the maker itself is not of the highest quality but it defitnetly makes a decent cup of coffee with, the perfect heat."
It was exactly what we hoped it would be.
"Very disappointing. The machine worked for just over a month, and now everytime I use it, it jams up. Water doesn't dispense and a lot of my keurig cups just get flooded while in the holster. No coffee dispenses, and I have to flip the machine and give it a few spanks before it works again. Sometimes, hot water will then leak out making matters much worse. This is a daily occurrence. I wanted to return this, but Amazon's return policy ends 1 month after purchase, and these defects started to rear their ugly face about 6 weeks in.I'm going to look into another way to get this replaced. These machines do have a notorious reputation for having some weak parts, and I'd suggest that if you see any problems within 30 days of buying it, quickly return it for a newer, hopefully fixed model. I will add videos/pictures very shortly showing off the problems."
Makes an extra size cup.
Arrived on time.  Love my Keurig.
Easy. Reliable. Great Tasting.
My kuerig ended up being defective. It was a brand new one. Amazon is replacing the product and doing 1 day shipping. Completely impressed!
"LOVE IT,OUTSTANDING"
I love this model! I especially love that it has its on changeable water filter!
"We had another Keurig for a few years, but then it stopped working.  I recently bought this one to replace it.  The water reservoir on ours stuck and you had to yank it out.  We put up with it.  Then, one morning, I sent water flying all over the kitchen.  I was not happy, but still used it.  Then, a few mornings later, my 17 year old son did the same thing, but this time whole plastic reservoir came out of his hand not only sending water all over the kitchen but the reservoir crashing to the floor.  It is now unusable and a replacement is half as much as the unit I just bought!  I realize now, I should have sent it back the first day when our reservoir was sticking.  Now it's too late.  I won't be buying another Keurig!"
Only used the coffee maker for a few days put the thing works great.
"got it 10/2016 for my small office ,2 months later now does not work. Water only drips out ."
"My husband and I like to drink our coffee black, so it is hot enough for us. It's a great machinethat makes a quick cup of great coffee."
Works great and was a replacement to one I had that died from a power surge. Thank goodness for coffee!
Will NEVER go back to a pot brewer ever again.
Love the Kuerig
It's a great graduation  gift that will be given tomorrow
Works well.  I like being able to brew multiple cups with the 48 oz. water container.
"I have had a keurig for years, so I was very disappointed that this model stopped working properly only months after purchasing it for work.  It is a VERY expensive doorstop."
this is a fun machine that makes great coffee!
Works well and makes a decent cup of coffee.
Great product. Highly recommend for the price.
"Gift for daughter, she loves it"
Taste is great
I really like my Keurig it exceeds my expectations
product as advertised
Too much waste with the K-cups. Cheaper to brew my own.
Love it.
I like the ease of use. Very satisfied.
Works great and great price!!
Needed a new coffee maker after knock off k cup maker quit after having it only 3 months. But this is great to have! I enjoy marking not only coffee but hot chocolate in it as well!
Stopped working in less than 10 months.  Had to send back to manufacturer.
It works just fine but is a little noisy and looks cheaply made
"It took a while for this to get delivered, but the Keurig K55 8s all I expected!"
Keeps on working well
Was not sure what everyone was so excited about this brewer. I know exactly what they mean now. I love it and would recommend it to everyone. Great performance and really convenient.
I love my Keurig K55.  My ONLY  COMPLAINT:  does not heat the water hot enough for me.
This was a great buy!!  The best single cup brewer I have ever owned.
My first K-Cup machine and I am very happy (100 %) with my Keurig K55 machine.
This makes about anything. Which I very much love. I get a variety of the k cups. I also got hot chocolate and tea. I'm set for life.
My Keurig K55 broke within 3 months.
As described.
My second Keurig.  So far so good!
"I love my new Kehrig K55!  It is a great addition to my kitchen.  Also, I'm glad I purchased the drawer to hold the Kcups - it's really nice, and made well...??"
"always clogs. a good ""spanking"" sometimes helps. very annoying"
Love my Keurig . Good price and fast shipping
"I wish I could give 0 stars for this item. This is the worst item I have ever bought from Amazon. It worked fine for the first three weeks and then all of a sudden it just started malfunctioning. It would either brew for one second (not even enough for an espresso shot) or it just wouldn't brew at all, no matter how many times I hit the button. Other times I have tried to make tea, and the water just completely overflowed onto the counter. I am really unsatisfied with this purchase and would like to return this."
"Love it! I'm not a coffee drinking, but this is allowing me to experiment with different flavors and not feel like I'm wasting a big bag of grounds. So many options!"
Works Great
Works great. A little noisy but otherwise makes a great cup of Joe.
Great condition!
"I mistakenly thought it was the same as my previous  Keurig.  Although it is not the same, it works well and does the jpb"
"doesn't work, had to be replaced"
Still happy with this purchase.
"Like it, runs out of water alot, I'm filling every other morning, convenient and easy, like it."
"Bought this for my girlfriend and she loves it, it's fast and convenient, she can't say enough about it so thank you Keurig."
"Not programmable, but don't need that. Good product and good price"
Very disappointed! It's giving colored water instead of brewing the coffee.... it's not my first Keurig machine / this one splashes all over!!! I AM RETURNING IT!
Love it. It was a gift for my daughter but I have used it too. Would recommend it.
"Perfect, thank you!"
Gift to a friend.  Fits his needs perfectly.
Excellent coffee maker and easy to use.  I love my Keurig.
The transaction and product met every expectation! I was very happy and would suggest others to purchase the same item!
This coffee maker is awesome.
We've had Carrigg's before and love them.
"im in love with my machine first one ive ever gotten, money well spent! im going to purchase a second one for my nephew for his office."
amazing
Good
Works half the time
Coffee not hot enough.  Costco had a better model on sale for just a few dollars more.
It is everything and more than its description?
Keurig K55 Single Serve Programmable K-Cup podgave as gift product worked for exactly 1 month and stopped functioning very disappointed.
very simple to use. I don't miss not having  a pre-program feature as it heats and brews very quickly.
Great. Love it
"I had a Keurig that was about 4 years old that finally started not working well, I would assume from calcium deposits from our local water that is quite hard.  I was really shocked at how cheap this Keurig was for the ""same size"" and it had a few less features but it seemed close enough.  Well, this is a much bigger downgrade than I realized and it isn't really that good of a deal in retrospect.  There is no blue light in the water reservoir which makes it hard to tell how full it is.  It powers down on us for no apparent reason although we turn the ""auto-off"" feature off (maybe we bump it or something and turn the auto-off back on).  It just looks cheap to be honest.  The plastic and the gray handle are all just matte colored and I didn't think I cared looking on the computer but in real life, it is a bit disappointing.  I don't miss the customizations that I never used on the old model (like changing the water temperature or not having a clock)."
Amazing! I wish I had bought one years ago!
Awesome.  Great coffee maker
"Did not even last a year.  This is my second one, last one lasted 6 years."
It's my first Keurig and i'm LOVING IT!!!!!!Great product!
I bought this for my office.  All my co-workers enjoy it!
Bought this item 3 months ago and it has already quite working. Trying to return it but can't find any information on warrenty.
Works well.
Does not provide hot water.
was great loved it
great
My fifth one for a present. They are great!!
Bought from clearance and it is PERFECT!
IT'S GREAT! WISH I WOULD HAVE HAD ONE YEARS GO!
works great
good size and water container.  Coffee is perfectly temperature.  Wish it came in chrome or chrome combo.
Can't go wrong with the the K55.
Just stopped working yesterday after just under four months from the date received. Was working fine up until yesterday.
Great
Worked for 1 week and then stopped working. Ordering a replacement but not sure if this will solve the problem.
love it
"works great, this my second for another home"
"Great!  Liked it so much I bought two, one for home and one for the office!"
Great product for a single person
I love it.
Love this compact coffee maker. I initially had the 2.0 but gave it away to have this one.
"This is the best coffee maker that ever came out, can't do without it, anytime I want a cup of coffee just press your button  and there it isnever drink instant again."
No problems.  Working great!
Works very well makes great hot coffee! Only neg is water container is a little hard to reattach!
Thing did not last three months. Should have stayed with Tassimo!
Our new Keurig is great.  We wasted so much coffee before we had it.  Now when I want a cup of coffee all I have to do is press a button.  We love it!
"my father really liked the machine i gifted him, im going to purchase one for myself. i recommend this machine is just perfect."
does a good job every time
I like the small size and that it is simple to use.
More cheaply made but functionality superior to it's predecessor.
Works perfect
I love it but it really makes a lot of noise!!
Great machine. Works well and makes a great cup of Joe
"The coffee produced by the Keurig is available in just a few minutes and is rich, hot and flavorful every time.  I can and do enjoy a cup anytime the notion strikes me."
One of the best buys I made.
This was a Xmas present for my teenage children and they LOVE IT!  It works like a dream!  I highly recommend this product!
Trying to adjust to the cups.  First time with them
Works quite well except that I don't always get the amount of coffee I selected.
It makes great coffee in seconds.  Exactly what I was looking for.
"Sometimes you have to work with this Keurig to get it to work?  Other times it does fine, and is o.k."
Easy to assemble and use. Relatively quiet. Gives me a consistently good cup of coffee!
Great product
Works as expected.
"I love this machine. I love the several different sizes, and the fresh cup of coffee every time. I use the smallest setting when I make iced coffees so it's nice and strong and will stand up to ice. I descale on a regular basis and pop the k-cup holder into the dishwasher from time to time - I think good maintenance is key to making these last a long time. I also use the biodegradable K Cups made by San Francisco Coffee Company so I'm not using a gazillion plastic cups. They're expensive machines, but SO worth it to have that fresh cup of coffee every single cup."
Nice machine. Heats up quickly and has auto shut off.
"We love this machine and have used it daily since we for it a few months ago. It performs well, the coffee is delicious and super easy and fast to use and no clean up. I have had some guilt relating to the excess of plastic though, and have bought some refillable pods. Unfortunately, they do no work with freshly ground coffee. The water fills up and the machine stops pumping, but since that is beyond the recommended use for the machine, that does not affect it's rating.  It works perfectly with the pods and with the refillable when we use  supermarket bought coffee."
EASY TO USE
Fabulous
Single serve was fine. Have not yet taken it from box to make sure it fits under counter.
"So far delivered as promised. Fast and easy, coffee is hot! This is highly recommended!!"
This stopped working after using it for 1 person for just 2 months. Our prior Keurig lasted 6 years! This product return window was only 6 weeks!
"Love this coffee maker, yet so disappointed that it lasted only five months! However, Amazon had me check with Keurig, and just over twenty-four hours later, I am enjoying my coffee once again! Great customer service from both Amazon and Keurig!"
Exactly as advertised. Heats up quickly.
Keurig came damaged because is was shipped in its own box. The tank was cracked in the top corner. Was able to get it switched out and works perfect!
My first Keurig...I'm hooked! Coffee never tasted so good.
Best coffee maker ever love it!!
"Great price.  My husband and I do not drink coffee, so my mom requested a Keurig for when she visits.  This isn't one of the fancier touch screen models but it works great.  And for those of us who aren't going to use it daily, the price point is great.  I noticed this is the exact same shape and size as my brothers nicer model, just without the nice screen and plastic instead of metal bottom plate.I did use a label maker to label the three sizes with the ounce measurements (5.25, 7.25 and 9.25 oz).  I dont get why they don't label those. But that wouldn't bother 95% of consumers.Another bonus with the cheaper models: no 2.0 keurig-only cup requirements.  My mom was thrilled to bring up all of her pods that wouldn't work in their 2.0 device at home."
WORKS GREAT
Love it!
Quality seems to have gone downhill. This machine stopped working after 2 months of less than daily use.
This is the second one I bought. Bought my first one years ago & it was still working fine. Gave it to my daughter when she moved out of state. I liked it so much I wanted to purchase another one.  LOVE IT!!!
This product leaked really bad so we called Keurig who replaced it with a brand new one.  I will never buy a refurbished product again.
"Used a Keurig at my daughters home and it was great.  Came home and ordered one, it's great. My husband is an early riser and I would always get the old coffee when I got up.  Now I have fresh brewed every morning."
"Although I hano not yet had the time to set it up in my apartment, we have the same unit in our firehouse. It is GREAT!!"
The best coffee machine for the perfect price. I would pay double for this machine.
"Haven't use it yet, it looks fabulous. Very satisfied with Amazon's customer service!! After receiving this coffee maker, I registered as a keurig member and purchased four more boxes of different brand kcup pods with 50% discount! Wish this info helps."
"We bought this as a replacement for a B45 unit that lasted us about 2.5 years. It has been solid and reliable, but we purchased the two year warranty, because some models just die early. Pump problems, especially in units that see heavy use."
"Fabulous, and quick delivery"
Much Better than the newer models.
Packaging was great.  Coffee maker was not as good as the first one I had.  Very slow.
It was working fine when we first got it then after 2 1/2 months it started messing up. I turns on but it won't make coffee.
Love it!
"Just amazing! I love my Keurig can't live without it, matter of fact I am gifting one to my buddy for his birthday!"
Broken after few months. It's says to fill with water even when the water is already filled. Water does not heat anymore.
"So easy to use and clean, love it!!"
"makes a LOUD humming noise when plugged in. still functions, just have to unplug it while not using."
Love the Keurig K55 !!!!!!
Great product and fast delivery.
I love it
"Parents took a little bit of time to get used to it, but now they love it."
the best coffee going!
Was my husbands birthday gift.  HE LOVES IT.  :-)
"I wish the servings were a little bigger but generally, I've really enjoyed using it. It's very user friendly and easy to use."
"I love it, I am a coffee drinker, the Keurig K 55 is an excellent purchase. I love the ease of use"
Top notch
Love this coffee maker
This Keurig is amazing! It's everything I was looking for. I bought this for my mom as a Christmas present and she absolutely loves it! Highly recommend!
OK not quite as nice as the one we had was and the big cup control does not fill mugs.
"Horrible! I bought this keurig in December it has been 3 months, an it had already went out!"
good
"This was a gift to my son.  We have had a Keurig 1.0 since they first came out and love it.  I'm sure he will find this one easy to use and economic because he won't be making a huge pot of coffee and wasting it.  This is economical to use when you use the refillable, reusable pods, which we use when our stash of ready made pods runs low.  There are plenty of coffees out there that are in the pods, and prices vary, of course, and there are online sites to buy them in larger bulks.This machine is easy to use, clean, and adore.  The Coffee Gods will be pleased."
Am enjoying the Keurig
"Perfect--fun to use, makes great coffee and there is never excess coffee that you have to throw away.  I love it!!!"
It did exactly what what it was supposed to do. Made a good cup of coffee.
Third Keurig I have owned.  Didn't disappoint !
Love love love!!!
I am  happy with it.
Amazing Machine!!
This is my second Kuerig and think they are awesome.
Works Great!  Happy with this purchase. Arrived on time in original sealed packaging.
Product is amazing. Works great. Love the choice of cup sizes. Would def buy again.
Arrived quickly and works well.
"This product was the perfect Christmas gift for my wife. It works perfectly, was delivered early and came in mint condition. Couldn't be happier!"
Got this in December and 6 months later now it all of a sudden stopped working. Not sure why but very frustrated
Bought this Keurig in January 2017. It quit working in May 2017. Makes noise and does not pump water.
Loving it. Would reccomend doing several initial water only runs through it. After that I was fine.
Very satisfied so far!  Quick to heat up and quick brewing process!
"The machine is amazing by itself, but what made the keurig priceless for me were the endless legit branded flavors!"
Great Buy!  Already seeing the savings with not going to Starbucks!
"Nice to be able to make one cup at a time for a truly fresh cup of coffee.  Also, a treat for guests to be able to choose their favorite."
Coffee in 30 seconds! Whats not to like!
As expected!
i love my k55 so much! hope everybody enjoys it this much. buying a second one for my brother right now!!!
"Much easier, faster, great choice"
"this coffee machine is as complete as it should be, heat temperature, the power, brew time it has it all."
great product
very simple and easy to use.  bought for may parents and they loved it.
GREAT COFFEE MAKER
The brewing machine works well. The coffee tastes great and is nice and hot. My only complaint is the water needs to replaced after 3 or 4 medium cups. Perhaps all do.
"Best coffee maker on the market, love the simplistic way to make a cup of coffee, so glad I purchased this product. DAVID"
Product was damp.  No directions or k cups were in box. Seemed to be a refurbished product.
Bought this in Dec. 2016. Quit working by April 2017. Not an issue of clogging either.
You just can't go wrong with Keurig.  The best next thing to a coffee pot.
works great
Met all my expectations.  Works fine.
good but customer service from seller was rude.
I like
"Love, love it and I don't know why I waited so long."
As good as it gets
nice yummy coffee
"Replaced our first Keurig after several years of use - got tired of standing on my head sticking paper clips into the spout holes.Thus far, the replacement model is easier to use.  Auto turn off after 2 hours, so no frustration with clock setting.  Buttons are clear & easy to use.The only downside is that the water container is much smaller.  With just two of us using it, we have to fill the tank every day.  A minor inconvenience, but still....It remains to be seen how long we can go before things start clogging up."
So far it produces a great cup of coffee as well as hot chocolate.
This is our second Keurig coffee maker and it has stopped working after 2 months.  Hoping to get a replacement sent right away.
Great gift!  Prompt delivery.
Great product; we love using it! Ease to use and works great!
Makes a great cup of coffee
"It came early, works just fine, and the side reservoir is just the right size I was hoping for."
great price and a great product
"Great item, I just love ir."
Product order was correct and delivered on time
This was a Christmas gift for a friend. She totally loved it.
AAA+++!!! Very fast shipping! Item as described.
"At first, this coffeemaker started out doing quite well, but I started having a problem approx. 2 weeks after I received it.  It would only make a partial cup of coffee or no coffee at all - and would not heat up. This would happen inconsistently.  Sometimes it worked with no problems.  Also, the water container is a small problem for me, as my hands are slightly arthritic.  I would prefer something that is easier to grip.  I will continue to use it for awhile longer to see if the issue has self-corrected."
"Love my Keurig K55 single serve, would recommend it to family and friends."
"LOVE Keurig Systems, and this was a gift.  The couple I gave it to are thrilled to have it!"
Exactly as I ordered . Very satisfied. 2nd Keurig I've purchased.
This is a great gift and my fiancé love it. It works as expected
Very disappointing. Never worked well and this is my second Keurig. My first one lasted over three years. Previous reviews are correct.
It's okay
Perfect foe whatever size cup I may have available and quick.
broke two months after purchase with no return permitted by amazon
Makes good coffee but I wish the water reservoir was larger.
Love it
Love it!
like it
Works great! Very happy with my purchase !
Works perfect
Works well.
Exactly what I was looking for! I love it!
Love this coffee maker..
It is perfect for us!
it was a gift  it was like very much
Love this product!
This was a gift since I like mine so much!best price.
Just what I needed
"Great machine, easy to use, easy to clean. No complaints"
love it
"Works great. Agree with others that components are not as sturdy as previous models, but overall happy with the purchase."
Pods are too pricey
Love this item great price!
I love this machine.
Perfect for what's s needed..
I am fully satisfied with this product. It has meet all my expectations
"I have been looking at Keurig machines for quite a while but have been very skeptical after reading the good and the bad reviews. I picked this one based mostly on several local peoples recommendations and so far have not been disappointed. The ""noise"" that some reviewers do not like is a minor annoyance at best. After reading the instructions and following other reviewers advice, I am pleased that it made it through the entire Thanksgiving holiday without any (knock on wood) problems, and I have a LOT of people visiting for the holidays. I was able to get a wide variety of pods for everyone to enjoy their favorite type of beverage including my hubby who only likes Lipton tea. I would give it 5 stars but the fact that it only uses filtered water is an annoyance, but one that I can live with."
"We have a Keurig 50, and bought this for my sister.  She loves it - the convenience of single serve, and the variety of drinks offered!"
"after less than three months of owning this product, it stopped working...making a groaning noise instead of coffee!!  ugh"
This is barely two months old and stopped!working! I would like a return or a working new.unit.
Love it!  Works great!
Christmas gift for my Mom. She loves it!
Bought it for my granddaughter at university.  She is very happy with it
In less than 6 months it started acting up.  It sounds like a lawnmower and it takes forever to warm up and brew.  When it is set to brew the largest cup I only get 1/3 of a cup so I have to brew each pod 2-3 times to get a decent cup! And I didn't get any de-scaling prompts or lights.  I am disgusted with this piece of garbage because I am stuck with it and am not about to throw away more money to buy a brand new one.  The one I replaced only lasted a couple of years.  I cannot recommend it in good conscience.
"Great coffee maker, needs to brew coffee a little hotter."
I was so happy to receive this Keurig because it came the day my other one broke--so I put it to use right away.  Have been highly satisfied!
Broke after less than 2 months.
Perfect!
Works perfect. Love this thing.
Just what I needed now that I am alone.
Love my Keurig K55 single serve coffee maker!
"Received on April 21st as of today, it no longer works.  Don't recommend purchase of this model."
Top does not stay open. Must've been refurbished by sticking it back in a box and selling it on Amazon
"So far so good. Havent had it for very long, but am enjoying it."
Great!
nice product
"Very Happy with it, only wish the reservoir was a bit larger."
everything i expected
I gave it to a relative for Christmas. She said it was great! !
very satisfied- exactly as described
Better thank i expected!
Good
Does not take up much space and very easy to use.  Nice look and able to fill water without spilling.
home run x2!
"It's clean efficient & you have your choice of coffee, tea or hot chocolate in an instant whichever you desire at the time."
Everyone in the whole wide world  should have one of these.... What more can I say. Love it
"Used it for one month and it quit working,cannot even give it one star"
it's my favorite part of the house hehe
Has been performing as advertised.
Works great
"I like the versatility of this Keurig for coffee, tea, hot chocolate.  Great price at Amazon!"
Makes coffee.
"Awesome products, will buy agin"
"Everything came in as ordered, works great, fast delivery. It was exactly what I wanted"
Got it on Christmas Eve.  What a nice gift from me to me.  use it daily!  THANKS!!
"I can't give a positive review on my new Keurig yet as it doesn't work. I received it yesterday and was looking forward to a good cup of coffee this morning only to find out the k cup holder was damaged. The ""pin"" that breaks the k cup was bent and the seal around it damaged so it would not puncture the k cup.I found this after spending about a half an hour with the Keurig company rep. She had me go through several steps, such as clean the needle that pierces the cup from the top, run three cycles of water through it, then try again with the k cup in place. No luck. Then she told me to push the k cup in gently to pierce the cup from the bottom and that's when the problem was discovered.I hope to write a better review once the new part arrives (7 - 10 days) and I can make a cup of coffee. The product was not listed as used so I am disappointed in my purchase."
i have yet to use it. But My sister in law has one and I love it.
best price
Excellent machine.
You cant go wrong with a keriug i like this one simple to use and can use any brand k kup
It lags a lot. I have to keep turning off and back on 3 times after waiting 5 minutes each time before it works properly.
It was a Christmas gift for my mother-in-law.  Shewas very excited and used it immediately.
Easy to use. Brews good coffee with very little effort: a vital feature in predawn morning.
Just what my father-in-law needed.  He really likes it.
Works great easy to use
Works great! Very pleased.
I have been using this since December. It's march and it's not working now.  Waste of money
Very pleased with the product and the service!
Came exactly like if we had picked it up at a local store.
"Will never buy a diff machine again, I  use reusable filters to use my own Folgers ground coffee and its PEFECTION, I use for tea, and don't dribk cocoa but can use for that, I like that there is ZERO waste of coffee  left over .  As  single person Id always end up over makign coffee and wouldnt use it!The one time  cost of machine makes up for all the wasted coffee over the years!!  I don't buy the Kpods , wasteful . just buy my  fave ground  coffee and use reusable filtersI  buy BULK size from Dollar General online , in  30 0z jugs of coffee at $6.50 , you cant beat that.Only thing I could use is a Milk Steamer/ device to  make cappuccino in future and they are cheap , but for now im Thrilled with what I hare. Using it 4 x day for 3 mos now"
Great!!
Good price
this is #2 I like how it make the coffee fast .good coffee maker
Hate it. Had it for 2 months and have a hard time getting a cup of coffee.  Good thing I saved my mr coffee.
Used it once and not it will not dispense product. Sad that I have to go out and buy another one now
Very pleased with the coffee makers Keurig K55
Easy to use - good coffee - good product
Great!!!
i recommended this machine to my boss and he loved it! i got a raise! rating: 10/10
"This coffee maker is on another level, I love it it's so easy to make a cup of Joe!"
"We gave this as a present, so far no feed-back."
It was a gift and she loves it over the older model and the sampler beverage cups were a huge hit.  She found flavors she loved but would never buy if she had not tried.
Awesome machine
"I bought this as a gift and haven't given it yet.However, I have the same maker and I love it."
"Nice product, does what it is supposed to do"
This is the second Keurig that either doesn't produce a full cup of coffee or doesn't make any. This one starting making small cups a few weeks ago and this morning it won't even make a cup. I have cleaned it and replaced the filter and it still won't make a cup of coffee. I purchased it less than 2 months ago and it is no longer available to replace or exchange. Very disappointed
"Works great, makes coffee soooo fast!"
Use it every day and it works just fine.
"So before Christmas 2016 my wife tells me that she wants a Keurig.  I'll preface this with the fact that we have a coffee grinder, two french presses, and a coffee machine (that I was against buying when we got that).  Here's the thing I wasn't about to spend hundreds of dollars to buy another machine which makes coffee but also I wanted to buy her something that would work until someday some new contraption is invented to make coffee while she's not going to starbucks.  So! okay here we go this Keurig is easy to set up, it's nice enough to use (I haven't figured out how to clean it), and its a good bargain.  I used it once to make coffee and selected the largest cup option and it did not fill the cup (standard size) full it filled it about half way - 60%.  So my advise to you is if you're going to buy a Keurig just to make your spouse happy and works fairly well this is a good one to buy.  I based my score on the fact that the machine does not fill a coffee cup full when used."
this was my first ever coffee machine and it was completely worth the investment.
Works great and is the perfect size for the counter.
"Great product, great price"
if you take care of it itll last.. mine lasted me for 1.2 years so not that bad.
we ordded this did not even had it a year an it stop working i will not never get another one there junk
Works great. Nice for a quick cup of coffee.  Buy Kuerig cups on sale.
Needed a new coffee machine.  Decided to buy this model from the high reviews!
Excellent coffee maker and their customer service is the BEST! I would buy again.
Works Great!
"Worked great for 2 months and then all of the sudden, it stopped working. I am sending it back"
"Arrived on time. It has a water filter, and the first cup tastes great. Better price than any I have seen in stores."
Love my Keurig. It came in original box brand new and a great price!
great coffe great price
loved it bought it for a chistmas gift for my gf and she uses it all the time.
this is my 2nd one.I love it
"it's a little loud as it prepares to the water.  But overall, it's a great cup of coffee."
Simple and easy to use. As advertised so we'll see how it holds up.
Bought my kurig in November and I love it! The best coffee pot I have had
Broken after 2 months of use. Worst product I have ever wasted money on. I hate to even give it one star.
Was it exactly like I ordered.  Very pleased
It arrived perfectly as all of my products have.
"Great coffee maker, love the fact that it brews a cup of coffee so quickly.  Fast delivery, great price!"
"Always great coffee. This is our second Keriug, we burnt the first one out! We love coffee."
We're enjoying it everyday.
Great Product! Reasonable price.
Easy to set up and easy to use Love it
I love it!!!!!!!
Works great! I'm not a big coffee drinker but I love making tea with it. Very easy to assemble.
We bought this in May 2016 and it has already stopped working. What a waste of money. I wont buy another Keurig product again.
great coffee...great machine.....HIGHLY RECOMMEND
These things are awesome!
"Easy as 1-2-3, nothing fancy, just smart"
Very pleased! my dad loves it!
This coffee maker does everything I expected it to do and does it well.
Very good and fast.
I love my Keurig!! Highly recommend!
I had a Keurig for years and was very pleased with it.  It started leaking so it was time for a new one.  This is the second Keurig K55 that I have received.  The first did not work right and I had to return.  This I am having the same problem.  You pre the button to start the brew and a small amount of water comes out and stops.  I turn off the machine and back on and it works.  Not sure how long this will last but tired of having to return!Not sure what the problem is here.  Either they are not being made good anymore or someone is selling returned merchandise.
Great
Great product. Enjoying my coffee everyday now.
Just what I wanted for my morning coffee.
Works well
did not work avoid seller
I am very pleased with my K55 single serve programmable K-Cup pod coffee maker.
Way better than my 2.0!
"This also was a gift, but people loved it"
Love it! Makes coffee very quick and easy to use.
"My old one died after years of service and I waited a while to get a new one.  But I couldn't stand it as it is so versatile and convenient.  If you are a first time user of coffee pods, let me say that while the instructions imply you can go from coffee to hot chocolate to tea to apple cider, you just might think about what last went through the discharge nozzle and perhaps run some hot water on the smallest size cup setting (which I love to use for instant oatmeal-it is not quite hot enough for instant grits). through the system.  Hot chocolate followed by any tea or cider is not pleasant.  And if someone in your household loves plain black coffee they will not want to follow your hazelnut or any flavored coffee.  Trust me I know!"
"it was a very cool experiment, easy to use, just fill in the water, put your choice of coffee cups and enjoy your day"
OK so far but had limited use so I can not say how it will be in the long run
It makes coffee..Nice and convenient
"Excellent product, excellent price and prompt delivery."
The box was damaged and the coffee pot was damaged and had to be returned
It's great. The drink comes out extremely hot and is perfect for the cold weather
"After years of seemingly satisfactory performance (and great coffee), I noticed a serious problem with my previous K55--that no matter how much I cleaned and scaled all parts of the system, the underside of the water carafe (the water outlet hole) and surrounding environment smelled of stale water--what I would liken to the smell of ""old used sponges."" Theorizing that it was a case of the machine just being too old or that the smell of vinegar, which I had been using in the cleaning process, was the source of the foul smell and could not be eliminated no matter what cleaning method I used. So I purchased this brand new Keurig K55, and within a few weeks of use, the carafe bottom developed the same foul odor as the previous machine. This time, I used Keurig's official cleaning solution (no vinegar) in the hope of eliminating the odor, but it had no effect. My water supply comes from the tap in a major urban area where the water quality is touted as pristine. I can't justify continuing to use this product because I don't know whether the seemingly unsanitary conditions under the carafe--apparently a design flaw--are effecting the safety of the coffee that the machine makes. Other than color differences, it appears that carafes of newer versions of Keurig machines are built the same way. Guess I'll need to stop using K-cups because I can't trust how sanitary such coffee makers are. Sad."
Love it! Saves me time each morning!
"Love it. So handy, time saving, and a perfect tasting cup of coffee each time."
We love the Keurig.
"These never last for me! Why Keurig?! I used to love your products, they lasted a while and were very functional for my family. I have bought 3 or 4 of these within the last 3 years. I am done giving you my money for this junk. I do everything correctly, cleaning them right, changing the filter, but almost like clockwork these things just die on me within about a year of purchasing them. Not worth the money!!! I went back to a tried and true old school french press and I couldnt be happier with my coffee."
Works great!
This was a gift.
Works perfectly
"In retrospect, I think a model with strength control may have been worth the additional cost."
Works exactly as expected. Traded my useless Alexa in for a reliable cup of coffee...thrilled!
Love it. Met all my expectations.
I already had an older model and liked it so much I bought another as a gift for a friend. Prompt delivery & it worked out of the box!
Excellent!!
Excellent coffee maker.  Find better and easier than the new 2.0 machines.
"Just made my first cup of hot cocoa! Very easy to setup, it comes with two water filters that you soak one of them for five minutes, then rinse for 1 min, then install it and your done! It also comes with a variety pack of 4 (hot cocoa, donut shop coffee, pike place coffee, green mountain breakfast blend). Cocoa was pretty hot too and delicious. I registered mine on Keurig.com and they have a reward system in place to get points for buying k cups, then using them to get it cheaper."
not even a year old and it died !!!!!!!  Stay away from this vendor
"Just to day it start not working bummer ,return day passed March 9.bummer"
This was a purchase that I have been researching and this was a great price and a great item to buy.
"Price was right, shipped on time. Great coffee maker."
This unit fails to produce a cup of coffee at least 1/3 of the time
Like it.
Broke in a month but to their credit was replacedNew one seems to be working now
"My order came on time. Where I am located I was not able to use this item. Two days ago I finally got to open the box and the coffee machine does not work. I went to my orders and then noticed that I missed the window to return...this is not good for me at all. Situation is I'm in Iraq working and because of my mission I was able to open this box not even realizing that I could have return it. Further more I cannot request a return receipt from the seller....I have SO many K-cups, I mean boxes with 64 boxes in each box. My mates and I were looking for this to work.BTW, my dash board reads that an item/s (not this one in questions) is still delivered but in fact I have already received it."
Xcellent product for an Xcellent price.....
Thank you.  The boyfriend said Perfect gift.  Makes delicious coffee :)
Works great
Just ordered in Oct 2016 and the coffee pot already doesn't work! Complete junk very disappointed !
"Water reservoir too small, makes a bit of noise, slower to brew than expected"
Good product and reasonable price.  This is the second one we have purchased for our office.
replacement a piece  of junk will not ever buy one again
Don't know why I waited so long. Great product! N
Works great
Not very happy. Bought gourmet coffe pods but didn't enjoy at all...very weak coffee even on the smallest cup setting.  Sorry I purchased...
A little noisy.
Works really well! Love making a quick cup in the morning- best price!
very good
Love my Keurig!!! :)
Keurig is keurig. Good product
works as rxpected
The motor is very loud and vibrates on the counter.
Gave this to my husband for his apartment in California where he works.
Love it
Great product does everything they said it would
Come on it's a Keurig for Pete sakes!  Love it!
It's very convenient and perfect for warm beverages.
"After 6 months, the Keurig doesn't work anymore."
great product.
It still taste like plastic. I have used vinager and baking soda . It still taste plastic.
"Great coffee maker, works super."
Flimisier than previous versions
"Okay, expected better results......"
New one comes with filter  love it
Love it!!!!!!
"Great price, fast delivery!  Have one at home and ordered this for our beach home.  Just as expected!  Perfect!"
"Great machine, Replaced 2.0. Fast delivery."
"Very Happy with coffee maker. Good deal, fast shipping..."
"Works great, looks just like advertised, and setup was quick and easy."
BOUGHT THIS AS A GIFT AND IT WAS SHIPPED FAST AND IS A GREAT MACHINE
"best investment of my summer so far, works perfectly for me."
My husband loves this.
I've had it for less than a month and it is already not working half of the time.
Bought this for my 87-year-old mother who has mobility issues.  She wasn't able to make her coffee anymore in her large pot as she could no longer lift the full carafe of water to put in the machine.  Now she can just make a cup at a time and feel independent.  It is so hard to get old and things we took for granted before are no longer available to us.  This totally solved her problem.  The machine is simple enough for her to use and makes a delicious cup of coffee.
This Christmas gift has already quit working will not order another Keurig
Who doesn't love a keurig. Arrived in two days. Reasonably priced.
Sister loves it
Very good
Excellent coffee maker
Best cup of coffee in a long time :-)
Great price. Fast shipping. Thanks
The best coffee maker ever!
K55 was everything I expectEd. It makes a great cup of coffee.
It does exactly what it's supposed to do.. Love it
Nice
So far so good!!! :)
great all in one shopping with the Keurig and the K-cup pod for sale too !
My son loved it.
as expected - very nice - fast delivery!
Coffee is weaker than I like -- too fast a water flow
what have i ever done with out it ??????
Great product.
Works great!
Great coffee maker!!!!!!!!!!!!
"great product,  wood like to recycle the coffee grounds easier"
"We are happy with our purchase, it met all our expectations."
Awe yea!
Satisfied with the product.
Love that coffee maker
very nice product works perfect
Delivered on time. The set up was quick and easy also.
Easy to use and provides reliably good coffee if one uses good coffee!
Love it
Have enjoyed the machine since its arrival.  Easy set up little maintenance!!!
Water reservoir arrived cracked. I can't get a hold of anyone to get it replaced.
Great coffee maker.
Better filter system than the one I had before
I bought this and it only lasted 5 months before it stopped working.
Gave it as a gift to someone. She loves it
I use it everyday
"A++++, a great product."
Gift for Grandma and she loved it!
"love it, arrived in time and best quality!"
"We were very disappointed. It worked with the first cup, but then after, it only worked when it wanted. I called Keurig and they told me to watch a video. I then went into Amazon to see if I could return it. Iwas told it was over 30 days so I could not. Actually I had purchased after Christmas, but had wanted to finish the ground coffee I had before using my Keurig so problems started as soon as we used it. I didn't realize I had only 30 days to return it or I would have used it right away, and not waited to finish my ground coffee."
Works perfectly.
time to buy a different color! awesome product 5/5
Gave it as a Christmas gift. Was told it was ridiculously slow brewing
"You can pay more for more features on a Keurig, like a clock the turns the unit on at the same time every day, and you can pay less and not get the water tank that holds 48 ounces of water, so you don't that to add water for each cup.  For me, the clock feature isn't important: Water heats to brewing temperature in just a few minutes, brews the coffee in a minute; I'm not fixing coffee at exactly the same time every day.  The conveniect of not having to refill the water every time is worth the extra couple bucks, to me.  The coffee will be the same.  The K-cups of coffee are more expensive, because of the packaging.  Again, the convenience of just popping in a disposable module, as opposed to grinding or just measuring, and associated clean up, is worth it."
Bought this for my office...no more running out for Starbucks!!
"Everything I expected, fantastic"
Love it!
Love it
First day and it works so far!
"More maintenance than the kitchen aid that we had (that worked great for five years and then died) but makes decent coffee and it was pretty cheap compared to the KA. Had it for one month before it quit working. Called support and had to clean the needles, but I guess I just need to do that more often. And the support was very helpful and answered right away (no wait with horrible Muzak). Up and running in five minutes after the call so 5 stars on that end."
Ok for the price
Awesome!
Stopped working and won't turn on after one month using it.
Nice compact and good brewing unit that delivers very HOT coffee which some other units lack.
Awsome coffee machine
"GREAT PRODUCT, EASY TO USE"
It was a Christmas gift for a friend and she loves it!
Simple to use and works well.
"Good price, quick delivery, easy set up, great coffee!"
The coffee maker works just fine! I gave it to my grandson as a wedding gift and he and his wife are quite satisfied.
"Our first Keurig lasted 10 years, so we ordered another when the old one died.  The new one worked fine for 35 days, at which time it stopped working.  Unfortunately, it stopped working 5 days outside the ""return window"" and Amazon has no mechanism for returns once you've had the product for more than 30 days.  We'll attempt a return to the manufacturer, but I don't think we'll be buying another Keurig, especially not from Amazon."
"Made my life easier to make coffee, clean and takes a min to get fresh coffee."
only had a month already quick working properly...
"As always, prompt, complete and meets expectations"
Crap. I bought it Jan 13 completely broke Feb 24. Outside the window to return it.
It was a gift to family members. They were very happy to receive it. It works great!
"I am pleased with this product, it performs just as advertised."
Great machine
"It's so great!!  Love the convenience of good coffee, time and freshness!!!"
Exactly what we needed and arrived the next day!
Perfect for our apartment!
works great just wish it held more water
Got this for my Mom she loves it.
Love my Keurig in my dorm! Great buy
Love it....convenient.......quick....coffee has great flavor.
I am having trouble with the water reservoir.
Like it very much I use it every day and night
Pretty happy with the Kuerig .
This item quit working after 30 days it doesn't give a full cup of coffee.
Great product! First time keurig user. Definitely recommend.
Great!
love it!
"Stopped pouring a full cup after just a few weeks. Trouble-shooted the issue and nothing has fixed it. Don't know if this happened in shipping or this is just a defective Keurig. But either way, a couple of dribbles of water does NOT constitute a cup of coffee."
Co-workers love it! Works fine so far. Looks brand new.
Great sale price.
"This Keurig K55 makes wonderful coffee, it's fast and makes great coffee!"
Didn't receive a filter cup.
Great coffee maker. Don't know why I waited so long! What a convenience
This model has some  improvements over the earlier model- the power button is in the front for one thing.  High quality.
We love it. It's used everyday. Uses the different types of pods.
As advertised.
Perfect
Bought it for my wife for xmas. She really loves it and uses it almost everyday.
best kitchen investment ive done in years
"works as expected,convenient,fast,no waste mess"
Great single cup coffee maker
this coffee maker was exactly what we needed at the office - works great
Works. Great my mother loves it
It is exactly what I expected. Works wonderfully!
My husband loved his gift.
I love my Keurig.
Very easy to get consistent taste.

Love it. I have been a fan for many years. I bought this one for my classroom.
Exactly what I wanted.
Works perfectly.
"If you want a single cup of fresh coffee in 2 min, this is IT!"
I bought this for my mom's mothers day gift and she loves it!

I love this coffee pot!
Works great!
"Great service, all around. I was and am very pleased."
"Easy to use, delivered on time.  Product was just as listed"
Excellent cup of coffee very well packed works beautifully

Better nm improved model Enjoying
Received May 9th...its May 19th...BROKEN!!
It makes great coffee.
Does what it says
Works great for making a cup of coffee or tea
Amazing!! Love mine!
"This is ok but doesn't compare to the vu I had.It brews smaller cups of liquid. and it seems like I am forever filling the water reservoir with water. It does have 3 settings for cup size and will probably serve most people fine, I like to have a big hot cup of coffee to jump start my day."
Fast delivery and no damage
Love it...very easy
as good as expected
It broke after day 1
This thing is 2 months old and it's already not working right!!
"I don't care for it at all, it makes a weak cup of coffee."
"Use it everyday, absolutely love it! efficient and easy to use!"
Works great
Stopped working after a month. Too late to return.
This is my second Kerurig. Very pleased.
works great love it
Love it.  Great coffee really quick.

This is the second one we purchased. We cannot be without it.
bought for a gift. was delivered fast and they loved it.
Definitely on the low end of quality.
Exactly as described and arrived on time!
Satisfactory.
The coffee isn't as hot as I would like it
"Best gift to self EVER!!!!Danni, St. Louis, MO"
Excellent coffee maker! Love Amazon's price!
"Very satisfied with the machine, would recommend"
use this as a backup and it works good
Great coffee.
"This model is very temperamental and not at all up to the standards of my previous Keurig machines.  Even if you do not fill the water canister to the max fill line, sometimes the machine thinks there is too much water and will make a grinding sound and not dispense a cup of coffee.  This is really annoying when you have dispensed several cups and it is apparent there is not enough water in the canister to fill another cup.  You have to start the filling process first, wait for the ""add water"" light to come on and then refill the water in the canister for the machine to work properly.  I bought two of these machines and both have the same problem.  I actually returned one of the original machines I purchased because I though it was broken.  Took a while to figure out the ""water issue"".  I would not recommend purchasing this particular model.  It is very frustrating to use."
"Satisfied with all above,"
It's great I love it...came very quickly...no issues
Works fine.
100%
My 2nd one in 20 yrs ! Love it !
"We bought our Keurig in April and it made the coffee taste like plastic, we thought maybe just because it was new so we cleaned it and ran a few cycles of water, but after months of plastic tasting coffee we are buying a different coffee maker NOT a Keurig. We loved our first one, but something in Keurigs production of products has changed cause our first generation Keurig did not make the coffee taste like plastic."
Awesome my wife loves it. Everything is working good so far.
crazy about it
Does not work-never worked. Returning
"I opened the machine, and it is clearly been opened by someone else. I checked the functionality of the machine, and it still works great. However, another thing that really makes me angry is that there were only three K-Cup Pod inside the variety pack that comes with the machine instead of four. The package was clearly opened by someone else, and as the company stated that it should be brand new and unopened box. I am disappointed."
My mom loved her Christmas gift!!
Great Deal and i love it easy to use and would buy again
Awesome
Great addition for my husband in his garage....
"Simple, sleek and works great! Good value for your money. Just a couple of presses of a button and you're on your way of having a freshly brewed cup of coffee in no time. I love the fact that this machine doesn't have a Mercedes Benz software infrastructure. I don't want to solve puzzles first thing in the morning just to have a quick of coffee. Not saying the other more expensive machines are bad or anything but this one is simple and works pretty much trouble free. Also love the fact that this comes with 3 unsweetened iced tea pods, 3 different coffee pods and 1 hot chocolate mix! Love it! Highly recommend it!"
I love it
It met all expectations. It was replacing my previous Keurig that I had for 8 years
Simple no frills coffee. Works great.
great purchase Keurig is a good brand
Excellent machine.  I love Keurig!
"I gave it as a gift, but understand it's working great."
Love it so convenient
Awesome
Very convenient for that single cup in the morning!
Great birthday gift!
Simple and easy to use. Makes a great hot cup of coffee
Didn't make Hot cup of coffee
Very nice
Works great & looks nice. Very easy to operate.
I need to send this back
Makes great coffee.
Love that fresh brewed cup of coffee everytime i use it and the kids love the cocoa
good machine
Just what I needed
The large cup button does not fill my cup all the way. Disappointed.
Great
Amazing machine .
"Perfect, just what we ordered"
"Had the original. The original started to fail after a few years - would barely spit out any water despite multiple flushes with vinegar. We did not want to be bound to only buying Green Mountain brand coffee (idiotic), so we purchased the cheap version without the bar code. And, it is cheap in my opinion. Absolutely hate it. Appears/feels cheaply made. You're refilling water multiple times each day (3 coffee drinkers in family). It's hard to tell when the water needs to be refilled...tiny blue light at top of coffee maker...noisy...just not a great product...I don't even look forward to making coffee any more..."
Was exactly what I was expecting. Love it
Great product. Works well.
Excellent product!!
Fast shipping!  Amazing product.  Love it.
wife loved it
I absolutely LOVE MY KEURIG!!!!!
It is very convenient
"Works perfectly. ""Yeah it's great"" - luke"
Am enjoying my Keurig.  Have been using a Keurig product since 2010.
I'm really enjoying using it!!
Very good - expectations met!
Need to get hotter coffee
love it
Best purchase yet in 2016
"Great value, great machine. No complaints"
Seems to be great!  N
Super easy to use and so many choices for coffee and hot drinks
Machine quit working after 2 months.
Very good coffee maker. You make just the right amount of coffee you need.
Love it...especially for my cocoa:)
It does exactly what I wanted it to do.
Makes great coffee every time.
good price shipped quick
Works for me!
Love it!
Doesn't work.
Replaced my old Keurig because plastic cover on top of unit at handle broke off.  (Unit was still working but the exposed top was dangerous!)  This one works great; I'm actually using my old water container which is larger and fits perfectly with the new brewer.
Works great
Love it
Great price...Great coffee
This is a great product
Everything works fine......it just makes very small cups of coffee
I love my. Keurig. K55give it 5 star
It's great
Exactly what I needed!
Great deal and customer service!
Very happy with Keurig unit.  Brews fast
My husband loves it
It was exactly what I wanted. I purchased it as a house warming gift.
We had a different model for 6 years. Finally died. Replaced with this. Seems to work fine. I only used purified water to try and keep it working longer. We have very hard water. My only complaint is our last one had a clock and timer to turn on and off automatically at specific times. I miss that. I just didn't want to spend the extra money for that model. I know we didn't spend that much on the first one we bought.
AS expected!.
As expected
does not work 6 months latter
18 year old grandson loves it!
"I took off a star because it does not come with the cup size I like. Apparently, you have to look for appropriate cup sizes before you purchase any particular model of the Keurig coffee maker. I'm used to 10-1/4 oz cups—that's what my old Keurig made at max size, and the size of my favorite mugs. The max cup size on this model is 9-1/4 oz. The other two sizes (there's only 3) are 7-1/4 oz and 5-1/4 oz. I have to run the 5-1/4 oz twice to fill my mug.I suppose that is my fault since I just assumed the cup sizes in all Keurigs were the same.Still makes a damn good cup of coffee, though."
Easy to use. My step father loves it!
I love it!
Very nice.
Love it
Came quickly and as expected
Great machine my 2nd one
High quality device that outputs delicious coffee quickly and reliably!
Great coffee maker
Great we like it
"Good deal, nice coffee maker"
Best coffee I have ever had
water leaks out on bottow
Enjoyed my k-cup to the fullest.
Exactly what I was looking for. Love this thing!
Disappointed this model did not have an always on mode as we have had in the past
It work like it should
Love it!!!  Perfect cup of coffee everytime!!!
Excellent product!
Was very pleased with this product!!
Extremely cheap and flimsy.  This will not go the distance.  They Kept the Keurig name but are producing the bargain basement coffee maker.  Do not waste your money.  It appears they are sticking to the standard of getting a excellent reputation and then once you have that pump out garbage.
just as advertised
Very affordable and great coffee machine. Use it everyday.
Did not meet expectations.
Two months and it stopped working very disappointed
"It's great,"
So glad I purchased this it is fantastic.
Love it.
??
One word. Awesome!
Love it
So far so good
It's amazing!
Works great love it
I love it. Good and convenient.
Very satisfied.
Perfect for my needs. Very convenient.
Very loud and handle did not stay up when loading a k-cup.
Bought it as a present for my boyfriend and he loves it!
This was a gift for my mom and she is very happy with it so far.
Love it....
"Don't know what else to say, it works great"
Great coffee maker
Great product!
Good
Yes it works fine Thank you
I love it.
I'm happy
Wife love the Keurig!
Works as advertised. Good product.
Coffee is not strong at all
"I have a Keurig 2.0 that I love more than anything in the world.  However, I recently moved and temporarily left my 2.0 behind.  In the meantime, I figured I would replace it with the very affordable Keurig K55 model.  It makes coffee and that's great, but it is kind of flimsy, there's no screen, the water source is small, and the coffee just doesn't taste as good (**this may be because of different tap water, or the new reusable filters I'm using).  It will hold me over for now, but if you're going to get a Keurig, just spend the money and get the 2.0."
It was purchased as a gift.
Well packed. Exactly as expected.
Very Good.
Very Satisfied. Thank you.
It's a great convince. I love it.
It's alright.
Love it
"Very nice,does a good job"

"Love it, but I wish held more water."

not as good as our previous one
Met our expectations
Love it! Great gift!
??
Works like a charm.
works very good all that i expected it to be.
"Best. Coffeemaker. Ever! We have had it for months with no issues. We use it for kcups, our own coffee, hot water for tea & oatmeal. We are big coffee drinkers, so it gets used a minimum of 4 times a day. Would highly recommend!"
My wife loves it!
Fantastic !! Amazon rock!
cool item
Replaced older Keurig unit.  New one works great.
Love it!
Very satisfying
It's wonderful!
thanks
"One of my best purchases yet and so much cheaper on Amazon than anywhere else. You can't beat the price! I love this so much.UPDATE:If you're going to buy a keurig, DON'T buy it from Amazon. Buy it at your local Walmart or Target. Mine broke within less than 20 uses. It got to where it wasn't registering that there was water within the water tank, and it would spew and spray my coffee everywhere. Then, it stopped even pouring the drink. It would just sit there and make that ridiculous roaring sound it does when it's heating up. Non-stop. All in all, I had to go buy a new one. I'm not happy."
I love it
Simple to use and perfect for my needs!
i really like it
"This was a replacement for a Keurig I have had for over 10 years.  From the start it would not fill up a cup, no matter which setting and the water did not get hot enough, lukewarm at best.  Today it gave me about 2 oz of coffee and the water was cool.  I am sending it back for refund.  I tried every think I knew about the machine but it is defective.  Now I've got to return and don't have the original packing."
".....Upon receiving any package, first appearance of the products packaging is very crucial to any one person's opinion. That there is the responsibility of the seller. But also remember, usually the seller is having their product shipped from another location, and the facility is to blame for the shipping packaging. My first thought about the items packaging was a 10 on a scale of 1 - 10....... This Keurig does just as it says it does. I haven't one negative remark to make about it. It makes it easy and quick to get a cup of coffee. Not everyone wants to drink or make an entire pot of coffee. A few cups and I'm good. I highly recommend this product. Love it!!!!.....When making a purchase, I take the time in reading others reviews and then leave as much honest ( positive or negative ) information as possible to help others.

Awesome!!
I did not like this at all. It made awful coffee and the size of the cups were stupid. I am not sure but I think it was defective. It comes so you can make three different size cups of coffee. The largest cup was about 5 ounces. The smallest cup was a shot glass. I returned it and got a $25 coffee pot that makes delicious coffee.
I LOVE IT
Love it!
Its great
"Love my Keurig!  I use it all day every day.  I've recently started experiencing problems with it though.  I empty the reservoir every night so there's no standing water overnight.  In the morning, after I've refilled the reservoir and set it in the cradle, the pump makes a terrible sound as it tries with great effort to pump water into the unit.  After repeated readjustments, it eventually catches and the water begins pumping.  That's the only negative, but it's frustrating enough to rate it four stars."
I bought this as a gift for my boyfriend and roommate because they are heavy coffee drinkers. This Keurig is amazing. It's definitely worth the price and the drinks taste GREAT! The box came with a sample of 4 K-Cup which I wasn't expecting. The owner manual is super easy to read and overall this is a great machine! Definitely worth the buy!
Has saved time and money with great taste !
Works even better than our old one.
Love it! Just the one I was looking for. :)
Love The coffee maker.
Easy to use... totally love it..
Broke within 2 weeks.
Quality was as good as new!
Great!
??
Makes a perfect cup of coffee
Love it
Fine
"Easy to use, quality product"
Good price.
"This coffee brewing system is exactly what I need.  I postponed getting a single serve because of wasteful packaging (K-cups), but I only use one a day, for the most part, so I'm getting over my guilt.  I don't really need the 48 oz. water reservoir, but it's nice when someone stays at the house not to have to fill with each cup.As I said, it's kind of a luxury item, and I'm a simple person, but I love the quality of the coffee I'm getting. I got hooked on the taste of a good cup of coffee early in life, so the fact that I can't have caffeine anymore hasn't curbed that.  I'm able to get a nice dark decaf cup.Just a note, when sending in the registration, had a frustrating time finding the serial number.  That's because I call the water tank a reservoir, but Keurig must call the draining place under the cup the reservoir, because the SN # is behind that and not behind the tank."
Just what I expected
"When it comes to coffee, the hardest decision I make each day is which flavor to drink.  The Keurig does everything else.I'm also the guy who, sometimes begrudgingly, makes his wife coffee each morning.  The Keurig makes that task much simpler than it had been for me when compared with a traditional coffee maker."
"Makes good coffee! Works great! I love the water reservoir. I love all the different kinds of pods or K cups you can use with this. Tea, coffee, hot Chocolate, apple cider, so many options! Only thing I wish is that the reservoir was bigger and that the cup holder had a warmer to keep my cup a little warm till I went to grab it, but I love it."
I bought two of these and they pump out some amazing brew.  The auto off feature is a benny as I use this at school.  I drink coffee regularly now that it is so convenient to make.  I'm pumped up all day!  I'm pumped up now as I write this!!  So much caffeine in me all the time!  This product is the bomb!  Highly recommend!!!
"Needed to replace Keurig given to us as a gift 6 or 7 yrs ago. Tried the k2-hated it. Tried the k15-hated it. There's nothing like the classic original. This one is just like the one we had except for a few updates. We just love it since we are coffeeholics. Just plug it in and you are good to go! When compared to the other models Keurig has come up with, I would give this one 10 stars if I could."
Two weeks old and already having issues.
Product is working great so far.  Wife is very happy.Side Note:  I bought an additional machine for my mom in law whose Keurig died within weeks of ours.  Her box came with the 4 sample cups but also addtional iced tea cups.  Kinda feel like I got shorted.But that is not a product issue so the five stars stay.
A+++ item and shippin
This Keurig has gone out - it seems like it is not pumping.  Haven't had it a year yet and it is not working.  We just brew us a cup in the morning.  It is not left on all day or used all day.  Really like the advantage of this but feel like this model is a dud.  We just purchased this in August.  Keurig K55.
Just what We needed.... thank you  :)
"Convenient, coffee good."
Poor quality!!
This thing is the best!!!
Worked as expected. No problems.
"More proof that R&D departments waste consumers' money. Since these people have to justify their jobs, they've never heard of ""if it ain't broke, don't fix it."" The smaller water reservoir is a pain in the butt, particularly since the need water light doesn't appear until AFTER you try to make a cup of coffee. Just what I need when I get out of bed -- more hassle. Of course, anti-development will continue. Wonder what they'll screw up next."
"Bought the coffee maker Oct. 14 2016 and by Jan.13 2017 (3 months) It stopped working.Yes it was displaying the Flashing ""needs Water, Heating and middle cup selector"" and I researched many of the availableresets and fixes online and NONE of them would fix it...It is now a $100 piece of junk that is going in the landfill.Never more disappointed in a simple device as a coffee maker....Heat water, pour through coffee grounds in filter, enjoy.I would think you couldn't mess that up but look through the latest reviews as well as the responses from the manufacturer (or lack there of)DO NOT BUY!!!!!"
Love it!
Works great
It works great
Just got this and have brewed maybe 5 cups and the machine has stopped working. It makes tons of clicking sounds and then brews only a few teaspoons of coffee. We will be returning this machine. So disappointed!!
"So far I like this ok. I had a newer model that had more options and looked nicer, as well as holding more water. I after a little over 3 years I started getting 1/2 cups of coffee pretty regularly- even after cleaning and doing all the suggestions I could find. Finally, after a few months of this I broke down and ordered this. I could not afford to buy one with more options at this time, but if this one lasts longer than  my other one I will be happy with it."
Not worth it if you want to store it for summer as the water remains inside the internal tank which can cause mold.
Purchased on October 10th. stopped working on November 11th. will not make coffee. water flows back into reservoir. this is the third Keurig in 2.5 years. I am giving up on them.
"Perfect! Just perfect! This Keurig hold enough water in the well for about 3-4 cups, depending on your cup size. Its very simple to operate and the convenience is outstanding. It's very easy to clean, and it comes with 2 water filters. I personally have bottled water delivered to my house for my water dispenser, so i use that water. What can I say? First thing in the morning, my only true love is my Keurig!"
i love this maker i put distilled water in it to confuse the BABE!!! I also change the filters on it like every 6 months to confuse the babe. and much more i have confused this maker so many times and it still brews like it did on day 1. this one is a little outdated but with all my savings going towards the K cups i cant afford to buy the new one with the screen and fancy lights.
Coffee maker worked on and off which is unusual for Keurig.  Biggest problem was finding a number to contact Amazon as the program would not let me return the product.  There is no easy way to contact Amazon and talk with a real person.
We went through all the set up procedures outlined in the instructions and it worked great for five or six cups. And them it starting making only a quarter or a third cup of coffee every five or six cups. We are using genuine k cups and went through set up procedures a second and third time. No good. Still brews only a small amount of coffee every five of six cups we make. It is very odd Sending it back for a full refund and will decide what to do afterwards.
It's awesome nice hot cup every time
"I am comparing this to an older version I used to have. What I don't like about this one is it seems to take longer to heat and brew. Also, if there is not enough water in the tank, you won't know until you hit the brew button. My old one used to show low water beforehand, so you didn't walk away thinking your coffee would be ready when you come back."
This coffee maker would be great for someone who makes a full pot of coffee each day.  I wanted a 1 cup brew.  I didn't want the reservoir filled with water sitting  for days. I will purchase another Keurig. My college bound son stole my 1 cup brew.
"Bought this for our beach condo which we rent out as my property manager said renters love to have Keurigs.Turns out I love it too, especially since I'm the only coffee drinker in my family!  Also love the quality of pods that can be found in any basic grocery store (vs. my Nespresso Pixie at home which requires special orders)."
My friend bought this through my Amazon account.  He loves it.  He buys refill coffee packs at CostCo (perhaps he hasn't shopped Amazon; I don't know).  Danger: it seems his caffeine intake has skyrocketed since he bought it.  He had wanted one of these for years but only recently came into the $ to afford it.
THIS IS THE SECOND KEUIG THAT I HAVE BOUGHT I DO LIKE IT BUT THIS NEW ONE IS REAL NOISEY HUMMS BUT IT WORKS DON'T KNOW IF THAT IS WHAT IT IS TO DO. BUT JUST LETTING U KNOW.
"I had this about a year now and it often does not work.  I have to adjust the water tank several times before it magically fits.  I have an older Keurig at work that works perfectly.  I love Keurig, but I got a dud with this purchase."
Hold enough water for two cups. If you have a travel mug you need to turn it on twice though as it only gives you a standard size mug when I push the large mug button
"There are numerous detailed reviews of the Keurig K55 and other models on Amazon and I see no reason to repeat or refute other reviewers' opinions, so I'll limit my review to my impressions based on one week's use and experimentation with various coffees and other beverages that my wife and I have tried and enjoyed.I don't consider myself to be a ""coffee snob"" but I drink a lot of coffee and insist on a good. fresh cup of coffee, properly brewed to my personal taste. For more than 20 years, I've used Saeco super automatic espresso/coffee machines such as this one:https://smile.amazon.com/Saeco-Philips-Intelia-Espresso-Machine/dp/B019771XIE/ref=sr_1_1?s=kitchen&ie=UTF8&qid=1481465394&sr=1-1&keywords=saeco+super+automatic+espresso+machine&refinements=p_89%3ASaeco ranging in cost from about $600 to $2,500 depending on the model. These super automatic machines allow you to load whole bean coffee of your choice into a hopper and at the push of a button, it grinds the beans, loads them into the brew unit, dispenses the coffee, then dumps the used grounds and is ready to brew another cup at the touch of a button. They are completely adjustable so you can brew your coffee as strong as you like, from espresso to fairly weak American-style coffee. They also have a steamer which allows you to make cappuccino and other coffee beverages. I love these machines and they make great coffee, but they have disadvantages. First, because you have to load the whole beans in the hopper, it isn't easy to change to a different coffee if other family members drink decaf, for example, or prefer lighter or darker roasts. Also, they only brew coffees, no other beverages. Lastly, they are complicated and require quite a bit of maintenance.Enter the Keurig K55, which is their least expensive basic model but does everything I expect. I purchased it for my wife who likes to drink my lighter coffee as well as various teas, hot chocolate, cider, etc. My thought was to let her use the Keurig and to continue making my coffee in my Saeco but I've found that the Keurig makes very good coffee and suspect that my Saeco will be retired because the Keurig is so much more convenient to use and maintain and I'm completely satisfied with the coffee I'm brewing in it, perhaps not quite as ""great"" as that I make in my Saeco more than satisfactory, and far superior to the coffee I buy in restaurants, donut shops and convenience stores.I won't recommend particular k-cup coffee brands because there are so many of them and everyone has different preferences. One of the main advantages to the Keurig is that there are so many choices available, with three brew strength/ water level settings, as well as a great variety of other hot beverages such as black and herbal teas, hot chocolates, ciders, and more.You can also buy reusable k-cup holders and any ground coffee you like. This may save a little money and also allows you to choose your favorite coffee even if it isn't available in K-cups. I ordered a set of these reusable k-cups and have tried them with several ground coffees, comparing them to the prefilled k-cup versions of the same coffees. The k-cup ones are as good or better than the ones I've loaded myself using the reusable k-cups and are SO MUCH easier and more convenient to use. They're a little more expensive but still reasonably priced, particularly if you buy them in bulk from Amazon, Sam's Club, etc., or find them on sale at your local supermarket. On average, I'm paying less around 40 cents a pod for mine. Other k-cup beverages such as teas and hot chocolate tend to be less expensive than the premium coffees I buy.The real advantages to the Keurig are convenience, ease of use and the variety of coffees and beverages you can make with it, including iced teas and other iced beverages. My wife and I can share a single machine and make our own preferred beverages quickly and easily. After she makes a flavored beverage, I simply run a shot of hot water through the machine to remove any off-taste before brewing my coffee.Although I won't recommend specific brands due to personal tastes, I will mention that I prefer well-balanced, slightly acidic medium to medium dark roasts. I don't like breakfast blends or other light roasts, nor do I like really dark roasts such as those typical of some coffee shops such as Starbucks, although I have tried some of the dark roasts from Starbucks k-cups and others and they are fine, just not to my taste. I usually use the medium water level (7.25 oz) setting. Depending on the coffee I'm using, this usually gives me a rich, well-balanced, fairly strong cup of coffee. For some lighter roast coffees I prefer the low (5.25 oz) setting. My wife doesn't like strong coffee and usually uses the high (7.25 oz) setting. Teas, ciders and hot chocolate usually taste better with the high water level setting.If you are considering giving the Keurig a try, I recommend that you consider buying one of the many sampler k-cup packs available on Amazon. Some are coffee only and others include assorted flavored coffee, cappuccino, tea, hot chocolate, cider, etc. The one I bought is this one: https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B00KSIE39I/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o07_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1 . It was a good choice and my wife and I quickly discovered our favorites. We've also bought a few others to try (on sale) at my local supermarket. All were good, even though some weren't to my personal taste. Once you decide on your favorites and the brew strength you prefer, you're all set to make good, fresh coffee and other k-cup beverages easily and conveniently.I mentioned at the beginning of my review that I'm not a ""coffee snob"" but I do insist on good fresh coffee, brewed to my personal taste. The Keurig accomplishes this. I realize that many people ARE purists (coffee snobs, in my parlance). If so, you probably won't like the Keurig but for 95% of all coffee drinkers, the Keurig is great. I'm more than willing to give up my ""perfect"" cup for one that's almost as good and so much easier and more convenient to brew, not to mention all of the other beverages it will make.I can see why the Keurig has become so popular. It fully deserves the five star rating I've given it. I highly recommend it to most coffee drinkers. I'm less convinced that it's the best solution to brew tea. It's okay but I still think it's worth the effort to brew tea by steeping it (using the Keurig to dispense hot water for brewing it if you wish). However, K-cup hot tea and iced teas aren't bad and are certainly quick and easy."
"From day one the lid on our coffee maker will not stay up.  So, you have to hold it up with one hand and insert the Kcup with the other.  PITA.  Now, it has started to only make half cups or less.  It is less than 2 months old."
What a stinker! Failed to heat water after 3 months. Of course it's past the return time for Amazon to help. So now I'm contacting Keurig to see if they will listen to my complaint. Even run water through 3 different water filters and still failed. Not sure 1 star is a fair rating.
"This is a little different than the old Keurig I purchased this to replace, but still basically the same (just some different design features, nothing huge). Unfortunately Keurigs appear to be built to break eventually, so I chose to go with one of the cheaper versions, because it's ridiculous to pay more money for a product that will break in about the same amount of time. My parents, my sister, and my roommates have all had a Keurig, and all of them have busted. Ridiculous. I'd pay a lot more for a Keurig that is made with solid parts (maybe less plastic internal parts and more metal) so that it wouldn't break so soon. It just seems wasteful."
This was a gift to myself and well worth it! I use it every day and have no complaints. I've bought bulk k-cups from amazon and use them in here with no problems.
"I love being able to make a quick hot cup of coffee, but I do not like paying the high price for the kcups.  I purchased a reusable kcup filter so that I can use my own coffee and not have to purchase the expensive kcups.  It is very messy when I tried using the filter.  I have not used my Keurig in a few weeks because I do not like the mess and do not want to pay the extra cost.  If I could find a filter that works, I would give it 5 stars."
"Bought this for my dad as a birthday gift! He uses it every day. His only complaint is that his favorite travel mug doesn't fit under it, so he had to downsize. He uses it with a reusable k-cup."
"This is actual 4th purchase of a Keurig - one as a gift, one for work, and two for home (over the last 16 yrs).  I love the using this on workday mornings when I barely have time for one cup.  Wish they would make the environmentally better k-cups - like those used by San Francisco Bay."
"Bought in November 2016, issues started March 2017 (about 3 1/2 months). Today 4/19/17 it totally stopped working. Lights flashing, won't pump water, says add water even though it's full. Wish I'd read more reviews before buying."
This is my 5th Keurig that has not lasted a year. So disappointed because I loved my morning cup of coffee from it.  I am going to have to find a new brand.  This time my Keurig did not make it a year.  Had a few problems prior to this that I was able to troubleshoot but feel like I really shouldn't have had to do that for the price that you pay.  Disappointed
"Just got it and couldn't wait to put it to work.  It is a little different from the one that it is replacing, works and looks good.  I have been using a Mini from Keurig waiting for this, and the capabilities are so much greater.  I'm extremely glad to have it in my house."
"I have had it for a couple of months now and it works fine. The reason for the 4 stars is the fit and finish. It seams like they did everything right when it comes to brewing coffee but the machine it's self is kind of, for lack of a better word, cheap looking compared to the last Keurig I had."
"Got this keurig to replace our original one that was leaking water out of the tank. This one is slightly improved from the original in the fact it is quieter and the filtering system is better. Otherwise, it is essentially the same. Great for basic coffee brewing."
Perfect for the coffee drinker who lives alone. Don't make a pot and reheat it over and over when you can enjoy a fresh cup at the push of a button. Great for break rooms at work as well. Faster than brewing a pot and everyone can enjoy a different coffee.
The Keirig brand certainly has deteriorated unfortunately. Immediately as soon as I got it it wouldn't brew anything close to the size of the cup selected. One day into use it stopped working altogether. Replacement unit just stopped working too.  About 3 days after the 30 day return window.  Huh.  That's just really shoddy
Packaged well and is working fine
"I bought this for a Mother's Day Present for my 92 year old Mom.  She absolutely loves it and five days later is still telling me how wonderful it is.  It is nice.  I've had a cup or 3 of Chai Tea, and it just takes one minute and tastes delightful."
What can I say it's a Keurig! Works exactly like it's supposed to. This was a replacement one for me
I have had this Keurig for only 2 months and it already is broken!
I love this Keruig!!!! definitely a must buy if you upgrade! i wen from a mini to this and im in love!
"I purchased this product December 28, 2016, it is now March 26, 2017 and the coffee maker now fills a regular size coffee cup up to one-third.  I have to press the button three times in order to get a full cup of coffee. I followed every instruction in the booklet and cleaned the unit thoroughly, twice, but the problem continues.  As soon as products/orders are delivered you receive a request from Amazon to rate the product.  Initially this product was outstanding; however, three months later I rate the Keurig K55 as a bomb.  I am most disappointed."
Took awhile to get it working properly! Still it's nice to be able to make just one cup of coffee in just a few seconds.
"Replaced older Kurig, it works as expected.... but I don't like the plastic handle and plastic drip plate... old one was metal and it just felt and looked better....."
Received on 3/3. Return window closed on 4/3. Keurig is already making loud noises and not producing any coffee. Wasted 5 K-Cups this morning trying to get it to work. Very disappointing.
Works just like described.  Perfect for a single person or a house full and everyone gets what they want.
If you like a lot of coffee grounds then this is for you.
This Keurig died today after only 5 weeks of making 1-2 cups a day. My first Keurig lasted 5 uears!
QUIT WORKING ONLY HAD FOR 7 MONTHS!!! Don't waste your money!!
"I wouldn't buy this one again. I love Kuerig products, but the water tank on this one has got a weird shape, so that it doesn't fill up. The back of the tank is higher than the front of the tank and so it's easy to make messes. Get a different model."
"Love, love, love this!  Very simple, wonderful coffee. Highest mark's for this machine!"
love this little coffee maker it reads and brews every k-cup ive bought unlike the new 2.0 even works with the plastic k cup to add your own coffeejust love it  highly recommend.
Very happy with our purchase. It's our first Keurig machine ever.  It's just what we need in our house.  We all like coffee but different types etc.  Makes a large cup in minutes.  I have no complaints.
I have one and love it so I bought one for my son
"I have one of these in my office and it works as one should expect. However, I bought one off of Amazon and this one makes a considerably loud buzzing noise whenever it has power running to it; does not need to be switched on. I find this quite annoying as I unplug it after each cup and have to wait for it to re-heat up each and every time I use it."
Replacement lasted less than 2 months and this one is not working now same problem.  Made maybe 10 cups of coffee total.
Great price
"Although, this is a Christmas present, the contents were inspected. I am sure it will be perfect! Thank you so much for the rapid shipment! Ed Smith"
it was cheap and plastic.  The old one I had was much better.Then annoyed as when I sent back had to pay shipping.  I am a prime member but sadly it didn't cover the return.  Watch out folks.
"it is not programmable - it only turns off after 2 hours.  You can't program the water temp, there is no clock so  you can't set the timer to come on at a certain time.  not what it advertises!!"
Great bought it for my husband for his office he loves having it in the morning when they have meetings with his coworkers before they start the day. It's doing exactly what it was bought for.
Makes a perfect cup of coffee. So glad we got this!
"I'm annoyed with myself for buying another one of these, some three years after tossing my old one out because of the insipid coffee it makes; i fell for reviews that praised it, and thought that they'd improved it. They haven't. I'm not a coffee snob by any means, but I like strong, black coffee, as many as 10X a day, and the idea of having it readily available is alluring, but this machine makes a weak brew that is completely unsatisfying, across a wide spectrum of dark road K cups I've tried from various manufacturers, so I'm throwing it out, again."
"UPDATE:  LESS than 1 WEEK AFTER BOUGHT (5 cups total), this NEW MACHINE will NOT PRODUCT ANY COFFEE NOW!!!!  NO water brought into base to dispurse.  I turned on and off, refilled container, tried for 10 minutes to get ANY WATER through the Keurig cup... and NOTHING!!!  ABSOLUTELY APPALLING!!  WILL RETURN! My old Keurig lasted almost 5 YEARS!  Lately it started brewing small cups (instead of my large 16 ou cups), couldn't get it OFF Auto turn on, so I figured it was time for a new one.  I paid extra $10 for next day... but before I unpacked it, I tried my old one again.  It must have been upset that I was going to toss it, as for the next 3 days, it worked like a charm!However, since so many of the reviews for this newer one said it only lasts a few months before breaking, I thought it best to set it up and use this, keeping my old one in reserve.After setting up, I placed my 16 ou coffee cup and pressed LARGE size.  Instead of filling my cup over 3/4 full with coffee, it stopped at a LITTLE OVER HALF.  It was then that I read the LARGE size fills only 9 ou!I only allow myself ONE LARGE CUP A DAY (I add SMALL amts of INSTANT coffee, espresso and chocolate to end up with GREAT, full-bodied cup of coffee), so this cup is very important.  I tried adding some water to the brewed cup, but end result is too weak coffee. I will try one (or more) of the NON-Keurig single cup coffee makers, but will give up k-cups if can't find good alternative."
Bought for church use.  Everyone loves it.
What can I say it has an auto off feature and for a family that on some days does not want to brew a big pot of coffee.  This item is the ticket for getting a cup f Joe and running out th edoor.
I like my Keurig K55 very much except the top part that you push down to puncture the cup continually falls down when I am trying to put the cup in. I would have returned it for a replacement but I purchased it on May 12 and when I went to the Amazon site on June 13 it said that I could not return it because I had had it more than 30 days. Very frustrating. Do I have any recourse?
Simply perfect! Coffee is quick easy and simple! Delivery was on time! I love my gift????
Bought this as a gift for my mother-in-law and she absolutely loves it!  She will be taking this with her when she goes to Florida for two months in January.
Bought our 2nd one in Feb and it's now July and we've been having problems with it for over a month. Like it wont brew a full cup and it sounds so loud even after cleaning it out with the descale solution and with just plain vinegar and even changed the filter. Loved our first one lasted about 3 years so bought another very disappointed in it
"So, so cheaply made.  I can't even believe this company thinks they've upgraded anything.  Drop that water reservoir top once and I guarantee it will crack. Sent it back."
"Wow, this is my second Keurig. Our first one lasted 7 years, so that wasn't bad. But this new one is so much better!! Faster and seems to taste better too."
Nothing better. I don't know how people live without one.
It is so quick comparing it with the old one.
Gave this to our daughter's boyfriend for his December birthday and he loves it. Set it up immediately and used it for coffee the next morning. I'd say I chose a winner gift.
"A little cheaply made I think. Perfect if you have a small space. I sent mine back , for what I spent it was worth it to just get the big one."
This coffeemaker is broken - less than 2 months after purchase - and - IS NOT ELIGIBLE FOR RETURN!!!OMG I can't believe it!Very Unhappy Customer!
If you don't have a Keurig you will not enjoy the pleasure of a perfect cup of coffee. I really suggest trying one.  I can't do without mine.
Best  ever
"We bought this for our daughter to use in her dorm room at college.  She really likes that she can brew her own flavored coffee in it, as well as being able to use K-cups, which she doesn't really use that often.  Her roommates do use the K-cups, so it works for everyone!"
The equipment came in defective. I called the Keurig customer service number to see if they would be able to assist over the phone and unfortunately everything they ask me to do did not work. Not sure if this is common yet be aware that even if you follow the instructions it may not work.
"After replacing a 7 year old Keurig with this new one, This piece of junk stopped working after one day. Just makes a continuous buzzing noise and no coffee comes out regardless of how many times it is started and stopped it how full the water is. Keurig has replaced their once solid consumer products with cheap junk. Replacing solid metal parts with plastic and obviously cheaper internal parts as well. Will never buy Keurig products again!"
"There are better things out there but dont get me wrong. For me and my needs i love it! Just dont jump the gun, do your homework before purchasing, and look at reviews."
"The electronics on my first K55 did not work properly so I exchanged it for a second machine. The second K55  was also defective so I returned it and bought an iCoffee  Davinci.. I've had the iCoffee  machine for only a short time, but so far so good."
first keurig machine broke so bought this as replacement. only bad thing is no timer on off option like my old one had
Tried to save a bit of money and bought a different brand.  It had a recall and I ignored that but it still only lasted one year.This one is twice as fast in brewing coffee as well. My buddy has had his for over 5 years with no issues.
"I love this coffee maker. Its nice to only make one cup for work, instead of a pot to throw away because I wont drink it all. It looks nice on the countertop also. I recommended it to friends."
Joke! Love the coffee but stopped working after a few months. Bought maintenance kit as recommended by manufacturer but still not working. Manufacturer says it's not returnable as it was bought on amazon and not from them... ???2 friends have similar issues with their machines. Will never buy this brand again!
"I looked for a clasic machine, i didnt want the Keurig 2.0 and all the control...  this is an easy to use machine..."
Love it its the second one we've had!
"Bought this from Amazon because it was less than my first one.  After a month or so, it started to act up.... not brewing and making all kinds of weird noises. I wish I can return it but the due date for the return has passed. I will never purchased an appliance online again. You don't really know if what you're getting is brand new or refurbished. Although it says on Amazon if NEW or USED, you can never tell!"
Half the time it does not make the right size coffee or any coffee at all. I missed the return window so now I'm going to throw it away. It sucks and do not buy it.
At first the convenience was a welcomed change but now I think making a pot of coffee in the morning and having it throughout my day might be preferable.  Plus the expense is even more than I anticipated...I use about 5 cups per day between drinking coffee in the morning and tea or hot chocolate in the evening.
Stopped working after three months. It stop putting out coffee. Just make strange noises
"I got this for my daughter in college. She loves it. The convenience is nice, especially if you usually only drink one or two cups in the morning."
pros: makes coffee of the quality level you choose. very easy.cons: you have to fill it with water and buy kcups. I kinda want an industrial one that has its own water line attached.
Yes yet another one I've bought so far still working I hope continues. I read everything on reviews decided to stay with older models after returning two newer ones. Think this company needs to get their act together
I have experienced bad luck with Keutig coffee makers = They do not meet my expectations according to their advertisements.  This coffee maker inparticular didn't workfrom the beginning and got worse daily.
"I haven't found a pod that won't work in it.  The reservoir is generous, I only have to fill it twice a week. Makes hot coffee super FAST.  Has automatic shut off. What more could you ask for?"
"Bought 3 of these to date and all work great and are very easy to use, while it makes a cup very quickly."
happy with  it
"very nice , had a small one  but like this better  don't have to fill water as often and makes bigger cups of coffee"
AWEsome product and service!
It acts up every day - it the worst Keurig I have ever worked with
"My second keurig. The first one i had lasted for 5 years flawlessly and loved it. I bought this a month ago and after the 5th day it started spitting out 1/10th cups of coffee, ( yes on the large coffee setting). it takes forever to even attempt to brew that 1/10th coffee. I have had it a month and its absolutely useless. I can't imagine a product lasting 5 days. Unreal."
I've had a Keurig before and liked it. This one malfunctioned intermittently from the beginning. It was returned and the service for returning and reimbursement was very good.
It did not brew a full cup within 2 weeks.I am a Prime customer and did not realize the return policy was 30 days.No more Keurigs for me.I put another single cup model and it is no better.They need to examine their decline.I was able to return to Bed and Bath and Beyond for a 20% penalty.Better than losing 100 dollars from Amazon.I am very disappointed
great cup of coffee
Kids got this for me for Christmas. Fast warm up and quick cup of java in the morning.
"Terrible, regret we even purchased this. We have had a Keurig for years and it was getting old and wanted to upgrade. This worked for about 10 days then stopped brewing the coffee. Makes a lot of noise like it is brewing but nothing. Went back to using the old one again. Spent much more money and I threw the box out and the receipts."
"Love it ,arrived in great shape, and quicker than stated. Makes great coffee"
This is the bare-bones model. It's still Brews good coffee but there's no clock to set it to auto start.  all plastic kind of flimsy.  It is the base model at the base model price. As a coffee maker great do you want bells and whistles pay a little extra.
great for this family. get a selection mow and do waste much as we used to.
"Love this and it's the perfect model for our lifestyle.... One cup at a time - nothing fancy, just tasty coffee."
Great coffee maker. Very easy to use. Makes great hot coffee in the push of a button
I love this Keurig since you can use any K cup with it.  I also bought my employees a Keurig for Christmas and they use it constantly.
"Works great, no issues.  I've had mine for 11 weeks now and use it 1-3 times per day for tea.  Brews plenty hot enough.  Warming takes less than a minute.  Quiet.  Very reliable.  Not a single problem."
Quit working after only 6 weeks.  Per amazon i cannot rerurn it.  Very expensive product to only have a 4 week return.
Absolutely love this machine.  I can't believe I waited so long to get one.
"Super slow coffee maker. The earlier models seem to be better! Love Keurig, but this doesnt seem to be the best model."
"This was horrible,  I love keurig but I had to have this one replaced witin the first week and now the replacement is messing up already within a couple weeks. ..I have to bang on it to get it to brew:("
This is the third Keurig K55 that I've had in 3-4 years....they don't last.  I've had this one for less than a month and it clogs up and finally quit working.
Great product. A hreat cup of cofee and works like a chram.
Great product.  Does the job.  Nice quality.  Easy to use.
I bought this as a gift for my sister and she loves it.
Wedding gift
Love it and sent this to my husband at work
"I have one of these units and use it all the time.  This unit was purchased as a gift, and she really loves it.  Living alone, she can make coffee as she wants without having to do a whole pot."
A late comer to this coffee maker.  Very enjoyable!
Product arrived promptly and was as described or better.
It's okay love the pot maybe just enjoy the model
Love it and this is my second one I have brought.
This product doesn't heat the water completely and therefore the coffee isn't full flavor. A little disappointed.
Can't say enough good about this coffee maker. Easy to use! Easy to clean! Makes great coffee! LOVE it!
We put this in our small shop and everyone loves it. Simple to use and makes REALLY good coffee with very little clean up. No more throwing out the 1/2 pot of old burnt coffee.
"Now here is a product I can get behind, I'm not a huge coffee drinker, but I do drink more in winter and enjoy a cup in the afternoon."
WEAK COFFEE!! Often tastes burnt...I wish I never bought this!!
"Oh,  Wish I had got a different model. Many reasons. But it works just fine."
So easy to use and provides one good cup of coffee after another.
I just need one cup at times and I love it.
This is for our office and it is just perfect
"The mechanics of this were broken and was probably refurbished, not a new coffee maker.  Sometimes it will brew a whole cup of coffee, but rarely.  Usually there's just a slurp of water in the bottom of the cup.  Very disappointed."
We live it! It's everything we expected!
Excellent performance! Use it everyday!
We have not used it yet but I love my other one
Stopped working 5 months after purchasing
Amazing work hose of a machine. Love!!!
Products  live up to its expectation
Gave as a gift and they loved it!
Works great.  Makes the coffee HOT!
OMG...my favorite...thank you....
This is my second one. I love it.
always awesome with the pods
Bought a different keurig through qvc.
"My boyfriend bought this for me on my birthday! I love it, works great!!!"
Should have bought this years ago.
"Love it. Easy to assemble, readable and understandable instructions."
The model from this company
enjoy a gtreat cup in the am
This is my second Keurig and we love it!
I bought this because I had seen others like it that I really liked. Since we have bought this one it has given us nothing but problems. I am going back to the normal coffee makers because I just don't want to work on this anymore. It needs constant repairs.
I loved my old one had it four years ordered the same again Love it
"Sent as a Fathers Day Gift and the manual states, Warning.  Use of this product can cause Cancer.  Seems the company should be able to design a product that does not allow this to happen."
"So far so good, pleased with it"
A gift for our kids. They're into coffee and love it.
A must at work
I really like my Keurig.
Best thing since sliced bread- love being able to try all different coffees without having to make a full pot.
Great coffee maker
It was a k40 in a k55 box.
its a amazing
great for the price
hope it last longer than keurig
Gave as a gift.
i like it..
Wish it put out more than 10 oz
Very good price
great
as exspected
Works as expected.
As Expected.
I like it
great
excellent
Fantastic!
Works great.
New home - new Keurig!  Cannot have one without the other! The most needed product in a new home in the mountains!
love it.
Works great
Nice unit.  Very happy.  So easy to use.  Great tasting coffee.
Good price
"Easy to use, works fast. Probably the greatest purchase I've ever made."
nice product
slow and loud
Product great. Shipping SLOW and without notifications. Was ready to return it when it finally showed up.First time Amazon was a disappointment.
Great
Not a great Keurig.  hen used with K-cup it is sloppy and makes a mess all over our counter.  Would never buy this model again!
One of the best I have ever purchased online.  Works great .
"I needed a new Keurig and I went for low cost. I haven't been overly impressed with this new unit. The water reservoir could be larger. It also drives me nuts that it dispenses cups that are too small. I have to run 2 cycles on the smallest cup size to get it about right. Then, it makes me open the lid and re-close it in between each cycle... all for one regular size cup of coffee. It's rather simplistic otherwise. It takes forever to heat up... start to finish it takes like 4 minutes to make a cup of coffee. Couple that with the expense of the k-cups, and I'm just about ready to go back to the old drip style maker."
"I love my Keurig!! I probably use it 2-3 times a day to make coffee, tea and even hot cocoa for my kids."
great
Awesome!
"bought The item on October 11, 2016, for work, after 4months it barely works. (mind you only 3 people use the keurig)  Terrible purchase."
Stopped working today for no apparent reason.  This is at a vacation home so it doesn't get used all that much.  Will have re-order and try one time.
half price
noisie
Excellent
Replacement for an older unit.  It lasted around 5 years and can not survive without my morning coffee and nightly capacino
Love Kuerig!
happy with it
Best coffee Machine ever!!!!
Second Kerrigan coffee maker to break in 4 months....this will be the last Kerrigan product I will ever purchase!!!
It broke down after 4 months of using it. Now we are trying to fix it.
I wanted a Keurig that would take the reusable pods as I object to adding to the landfill with the refilled ones.  It works great and I'm very happy with my Keurig.
"Super convenient, makes quick cup, each guest can enjoy their favorite flavor of coffee, easy for elderly parent to fix own cup, surpassed my expectations."
"My expensive Cuisinart's Keurig died a few months ago and I purchased this one to replace it. I have had it for 3 months, make only 2 cups of coffee per day and its broken already. It appears water won't come through the machine. Its not clogged but because I checked the needle yesterday. To say I am angry is an understatement.  Of course I didn't keep the box it came in. Not pleased at all.....Edited on August 30.  I was planning to toss this Keurig but decided to give  it one more try. I removed the water container, and picked the coffee maker up and placed it down on the counter several times to "" knock the air out""...GENTLY. Replaced the carafe, added water and voilà its working.  I now refuse to remove the container and simply add water with another pitcher.  I believe the problem was an air bubble in one of the lines. I am very pleased with it now."
Love it!
loved it
Love this Keurig.
Worked great for 1 week.  Then stopped working.  Waiting for replacement.  Very unhappy.
Get it on sale!
Love it! Easy to use.
"This is our 3rd Keurig.  Got this spring... moderate use... completely died in 10 weeks.  Keruig replacing for free... but long wait time.  All of ours have died ""before their time.""  This well be our last."
Love my new coffee machine.Very quiet and efficient
I bought this and within one week it stopped working but amazon send me a label AND SENT A NEW ONE RIGHT AWAY!! the 2nd one works great ....coffee anyone
The boxed was beated up. The water doesn't brew. I bought it as a gift & the person had to PAY to get it fixed. Embarrassing. I DO NOT recommend.
I like it fine but I found the exact same thing later for about $10 less at a store nearby so it was no bargain.
A+++++
works like a charm
"Really exceeded my expectations, I've had several other Keurigs and none work like this!"
Makes coffee and tea great. Can't believe it took me so long to order one. Great product.
Makes coffee.  Perfect every time.
Never again Keurig. Second product. Same design flaw as first.
"Brand new, works great, I love it!"
as expected
Gift
Very simple to use for my blind husband no electronics on itt. He could not use the touch window one I have.
We've it. So easy to use.
"Works great! This gets used about 3 times a day for either coffee,  tea,  or hot cocoa."
Nice job!! Quick shipping. Thank you.
This model is not good. Handle does not work  like it should. Ths is not up to keurig standards.
Excellent
Love it so much
My husband can make his own coffee.
Love Keurig!
Bought as a spare. still in box.
Thought it was new but looks used. Will be returning
"It does not work properly.  I need to return it, can you tell me how?"
It brews good coffee but not espresso. Simple to use.
Great machine !!
From start to  finish it Makes a very loud noise  . Not happy at all with this product.  Just waiting for another brand to  come out with a better product.
Love it
"My 1st. CM'er. It really is a cool piece! Sleek design, and great features. I should have purchased the timer version. Still, I really do love it!!You can't go wrong with this CM'er."
I love this darn coffee machine. Great price. Came within a few days!
"defected product, hope 2nd purchase is worth it.."
The keurig the day we got it.We should get another one
My mother loves using it in the afternoon when she wants one cup.
"Unfortunately, it did not work properly and was unusable."
Excelent coffe machine.
This does not work..Light comes on but does not brew
This thing sucks more than Hillary. It doesn't work
"SLOW RUNNING, NOT AS ADVERTISED,"
"Small Coffee filter basket doesn't close, can't use it."
love it--can make a cup anytime without having to make a whole pot  of coffee
purchased as a gift
Love it!!
Perfect !
Good hot coffee!
Love it
"Everything as promised, great job,from start to finish"
Works great
Love it. Simple reliable. Perfect coffee everytime
"Wife loves it, which means I love it."
Noisy but functions ok
Given as a gift and recipient loved it.
Purchased this for another person--so far so good!!
"There r times after Keurig heats up and coffee pod in place,  Less than half of  cup is filled with coffee."
Came in on time and worked out very well I bought it for my daughter hers died after years of service. She loves it I have two
It works great as we only drink tea so there is always hot water for our tea.
works great
"Your ad lead me to believe this was the latest model but when I got your mail for rating it said ""older model"""
None
"Just bought my first Keurig.  Disappointed in the fact that YOU CAN NOT dump the water from inside the tank!!!  Hoping I don't taste any residue from old nasty water.  I'm thinking I will need to run vinegar threw it at least once a week to sanitize the interior! This is the way the manufacturer also descales the machine. I have looked at many videos on YOU TUBE describing how to take the bottom off and clip a tie wrap to drain interior tank.  This is what I expect you must do to return a Keurig for warranty?!  On the upside it does make a great cup of coffee, just wish the engineer had designed a way to dump all water from the machine."
please don't buy this product. I bought is for 7 month ago and I just use it for 10 times but al of sudden it doesn't work.I'm so disappointed.
"I bought this machine on November 27 and it died today. The machine was used probably once every day or two, so it was not heavily used."
Works great!! Love it.
Great machine.
Not working
Love this thing!! Hot yummy black lava!
Fast perfect coffee maker; highly recommend it
I love it
LOVE IT~~~~
"Quick deliver, wonderful product, very happy customer"
Grear coffee maker
It's a very efficient coffee maker.
Terrible reliability. I had to return three of them because they kept breaking. I tried iCoffee and it is working beautifully.
The Auto Shut Off is perfect!
"Great coffee, consistent and hot. Works wonderful"
love it!  The coffee comes out HOT- not lukewarm.
I bought for my sister - she loves it !
Had the original Elite.  BETTER. And HOT.  And we loved the original.
Just as advertised
Just great!
"for just 100$ its a good product even if it last 4 months, still made you save money by not buying coffee but Brewing yourself."
It worked great!
It is wonderful because it is so fast & little clean up.  I use one at work so I knew I had to have one at home!
Bought this one to replace my old Keurig that had worn out after 3 and a half years. It works great!
The shipping was super fast. I received it before expected. The product is exactly as described and so far it's working great.
Can't beat a keurg it's the best
Love it Got it for work
wish it ha a larger water reservoir
"I am not happy with it, it doesn't work good at all something wrong with it"
Exactly what I wanted. Easy to use and easy to clean!
Ideal for two people that have different tastes in coffee.
im in love!! planning to buy a second one
I love it!  It met all my expectations.
"supposed to make 4, 6 and 8 oz of coffee. got 2, 4 and 6 oz when brewed. also coffee was warm and not hot after brewing."
Enjoying using it especially in the morning before I go to work and when I have some company.
Bought this for my 76 yr. Old mother. She said it's so easy to use she can do it I the dark!
like it
defective product. The electrical plug will not fit any 110V outlet in my home.
i love this Coffey maker it is a wonderful  item i don't know how i ever lived with out it
"great product, a bit bulkier than I like on my kitchen counter"
Great
it took a while to get to me but other wise I love it
POS broke after a week of just one cup a day of use. Wish I could give negative stars to this thing.
was advertised as used. the reservoir is cracked. temporary fix with super glue.
Just as expected
We love it
Where is the clock i used to have on my old one? Have to turn it on every morning
Perfect.
Tank to small
sporadic  problems with water not running through pod into coffee cup
a lot of warer refills
"replaced one that quit after several years. Great system, could have a larger water tank."
last keurig had a bigger water container should have did better research
Product looked just like new!  Product works well!
Makes great coffee.  Arrived at my door in 5 days.
This coffee maker serves me quickly and is satisfying.
Great
Use it everyday. Very fast.
Everything was fine.
Completely quit one day after return window closed!  31days!
Not as expected. Will probably return
love it
"Product is fine ., was delivered in a beat up box .. It looked used."
awesome ujnit
Works excellent.  Very happy.
It is a back up for the older one I have had several years.
Yes I love my new keurig works great
This arrived poorly packaged.  the water chamber was cracked.
Have to add water too often.  Need the larger size.
Enjoying it every day.
Very Happy with my Keurig K55. Thank You...

Great !
Perfect for work without the messy cleanup.
Coffee maker was exceptional
Product is awesome.
This is our second one. No problems just good coffee.
Doesn't work to my expectations.
Perfection!
Leaks all over counter down onto cabinets.
I love my new Keurig! I use it everyday and it works great
Worked great
How much is the single cup you just showed me
Coffee is hot.
I got this for my son and he said it was great!

All is good
"I ordered a RED colored Keurig coffee maker for Mother's Day gift. To my disappointment I received a black one, omg. I just hope my mother who's extremely picky like it.??"
Great buy!
I like it.
Love it
"My mother's wrist pain made using a conventional coffee pot too hard.  I got her this because it is so easy to make coffee with.  No measuring, no guessing, and the reservoir lets you make multiple cups before having to refill.  Now my mother can have as much coffee as she wants without having to turn her wrist much or deal with coffee cans, filters, and filling the pot."
Best one ever
I love it!
Great
"WE PURCHASED THE ITEM FOR A ""BACK UP"" TO OUR EXISTING KEURIG COFFEE MAKER.  THE AMAZON PRICE, FREE SHIPPING,AND PROMPT DELIVERY WAS OUR MAIN REASON.  WE HAVE ENJOYED KEURIG COFFEE FOR YEARS AND AT OUR AGE, 87 AND 81 RESPECTIVELY, WE DON'T WANT TO WAIT TWO OR THREE DAYS IN THE EVENT OUR ""OLD MAKER"" WOULD BREAK DOWN.WE FIGURE THIS IS THE LAST COFFEE MAKER THAT WE WILL EVER HAVE TO PURCHASE.........ANY BETS THAT WE OUTLIVE IT??AMAZON HAS BEEN GREAT FOR US IN OUR PREVIOUS PURCHASES......."
It hasn't been opened yet because it is a Christmas gift.  I have one in the red and I love it.
This was a gift. Great that it works with generic K-cups.
Our second Keurig - one in the house - one in the apartment.
Excellent product and price.
first cup down.  worked.  i have hot coffee.
Great for the price.
This stopped working a little over 2 months after I bought it.
As Expected.
Awesome.  Boss loves it.
Terrible!!! Bought one and it worked for about 10 cups of coffee.. then it completely stopped working. Returned it and got a replacement. The SAME THING happened. Only this time after 4 cups of coffee. Going to send it back and not buy another one. Keurig is terrible so unreliable! DO NOT BUY!!
When it arrived was looking. Forward to a nice cup. Coffee.  But. No. power.  Tried everything. But still no power.  I have. Returned.  it.  It has been. Delivered. Waiting for it to be confirmed.  And my  Money. Put  into my account. Plus. £15 towards. Postage.
good
this was a gift
"Makes really weak coffee.  I even tried the ""teacup"" setting."
Great price.
Had to send it back. Would not work.
what i wanted
"It's a Keurig, enough said."
So far so good
It quit working less than 3 months later.  Do not waste your money.
"I don't think I've ever given a one-star rating before,  but this coffee maker is a rip-off.  It's expensive, it's huge (you'd think it would make ten cups of coffee given the size), and the coffee is weak weak weak, no matter what cups you use and how small the amount of water."
Love my keurig!It came earlier than expected so great surprise to find it at my door when I was heading to the store to buy instant coffee.
It's broken. Was broken in the box. But I had already thrown out the packaging when I noticed it. The lid to the keurig machine won't stay up.
What a piece of junk! This is our second Kuerig. Had to return the first one after a couple of months when it stopped working. Same this happened to this one. Anybody need a boat anchor?
Ok as far as this kind of coffee maker goes.  I think the coffee pods taste like cardboard (nearly all brands).Would much rather have my drip coffee maker.  Do like the hot chocolate though.
Love my Keurig K55.
Wonderful product!  Passed the one I had previously onto my daughter.  We're a Keurig family.
it is made cheap
It seems there is a problem.  I get sludge at the bottom of the cup and an icky froth on the top.  I then ordered the disposable paper liners thinking that would solve the problem. That made it worse.  The coffee was very very weak.  *sigh* No one else seems to have this problem. I guess from the cost of this I should have purchased the Hamilton Beach.
Good
I felt like this product was used already.
Wish it would make stronger coffee.
everything went well from beginning to end.
It's not up to par '  it pours to slow not really happy with it .  Wanted a 2.0

Broken after 2 months and very little use. How can I get a replacement?? Thank you.
"Yuck. Have returned it - made nasty coffee, no matter which type I tried."
"Broke a week after I bought it,  piece of junk. I  tossed it in the trash. Bought a drip coffee maker and never looked back."
Works
"Working good so far , Thanks"
Junk
Water tank was broken causing huge leak... would like replaced but can't find sellers contact info ??
"Have always loved the keurig brand, and will be gifting this to my father. Very recommended brand."
"Almost love it. I would totally love it if I always used the store-bought pods.  Sure wish the blue LED lights could be disabled. I come out in the morning in the dark to make coffee, don't want to turn on the house lights yet and this blue light practically blinds me - I have to put something over it.  Probably the same problem in all the machines with bright LED lights. Lower intensity lights or a diffuse lens over them would sue help!"
needs to include a cup so I can use my own grounded coffee beans.
"So disappointed by this product. Problems: the coffee is not very hot, the coffee is not very strong or flavorful, the machine is insanely noisy as it warms up."
"This product along with the K cups holder were suppose to go to my son in Colorado and both have arrived here in Virginia. I think you should make good on this.Thanks,"
fantastic product. well made. easy to use.
